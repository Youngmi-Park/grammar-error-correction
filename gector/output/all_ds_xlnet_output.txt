On Saturday mornings when the dality met in the chapel to recite the little office , his place was a cushioned neeling desk at the right of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the responses.
Her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity . Her holiness , a strange light blowing faintly upon her frail flesh , did not humiliate the sinner who approached her.

It was strange that he found an arrid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel more deeply his own condemnation.
The sentence of Saint James , which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all , had seemed to him at first a swoll and phrase until he had begun to grop in the darkness of his own state.

the uncouoth faces passed him by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference , a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face.

Their piety would be like their names , like their faces , like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble land , contrite hearts might be paid a far more tribute of devotion than his had ever been , a gift ten fold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration.
It was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride , beaten and inbeggars weeds , that they would be generous towards him , loving him as themselves.
idle and imbittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love , but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love.

You will find me continually speaking of formen tision hole bine turner and tin cutet in almost the same terms.
the united every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorests sometimes as kirus scuruss.
By being studious of color , they are studious of division and while the curoscurest devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing , unseparated light , the colorests have for their function the attainment of beauty by rangement of the divisions of light.
My first principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy this method of lang portions of distinct hues side by side.
Some of the touches indeed when the tenteras are mixed with water have been laid in little drops er pands so that the pigment might crystalize hard at the edge.

the brown ground beneath his left , for the most part , one touch of black as put for the hollow to delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandable.
To believe me , the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock rob in this to be read and a bagrass plot to be green and the best skill fart is instantly seizing on the manofold deliciousness of light which you can only seeise by precision of instintaneous touch.
Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonizes with the other hues , it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds and the round window will tell as jeels if they are gradated justly.
but in this favourite cappit from the turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly.
They are beyond all other works that I know , existing dependent on their effect on more subdued tones . Their favourite choice in time of day is either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets are produced chiefly out of gray paper.

Do not , therefore , think that Gothic schools are easy one.s
The law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mysterious faintness as shall be delightful and I have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground.
This at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative , that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that , in fact , you are producing jeweler 's work rather than pictures.
Their style as restrained or severe does not mean that it is also a runius.
In all early gothic art , indeed , you will find failure of this kind , especially distortion and regidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid ropose of classical art.
The large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that are merely child ish in failing work of an inferior hand . It is not characteristic of Gothic or any other school.
But observe you can only do this on one condition , that is striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in your imagination.
It will be holly impossible for you to retain the tranquility of temperant felicity of faith necessary from noble purice painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and pece of practical life.

Nothing will be more precious to you , I think , in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way and things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter.
You know , I've just been telling you how the school materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire.
Here 's an equally typical Greek school landscape by Wilson Lost Wholy and Golden Nest , the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees were towers and no care for color whatsoever , perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist a pollo and the pifhon.

It was this observation that was true from Douglas then immediately , but later in the evening of reply that had an interesting consequence to which I call attention.
Someone else told a story not particularly affective which I saw he was not following.

Let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what I shall presently give.
power dogbess before his death when it was in sighe committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of those days and that , on the same spot with immense effect , he began to read to our quiet little circle of the night of the fourth
The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't , of course , thank heaven stay . They departed in consequence of arrangements made in a range of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up.
The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a like fe gun.
He had his own town residence , a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase , but it was to his country home and old family place in Essex that he wished immediately to proceed.
The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relationships and that his own affairs took away as much time.
There were plenty of people to help , but , of course , the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority.
I expect
She was young . I'm very nervous . It was a vision of serious duties and little company for really great loneliness.
Hehs , but that's just the beauty of her passion.
It was the beauty of it.
It sounded dull , that sounded strange and all the moresor because of his main condition , which was.
She promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when , for a moment , thisburdent delighted , he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she had already felt rewarded.
but it was all her reward , which of the ladies asked.
how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the groth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child.
God , as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished , had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parents for ever with the race and descent of morals and to be finely a blessed soul in heaven.
yet these thoughts affected Hester Prin less with hope than apprehension.
The child had a native grace which does not embariably coexist with faultless beauty . It's a tiring , however simple , always impresses the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best.
This outward newt ability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life.
Hester putd only account for the child's character and even then , most vagally ends imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from the material of earth.
there were now alluminated by the morning radionce of a young child's disposition , but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whor awind.
Hester Prin nevertheless , the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of being on the side of undue soverity.
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes , she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant and mortality that was committed to her charge.
As to any other kind of discipline , whether address to her mind or heart , a little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordnace with the kaprice that is rolling at the moment.
It was a look so intelligent yet anexplicable perverse , sometimes so malicious , but generally accompanyed by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not hesitate to question at such moments whether pearl was a human child.
beholding it , haster was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elph in the flight which she envariably began to snatch her to her bosom with close pressure and earnest kisses , not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive.
brooding over all these matters , the mother felt like a wone who has a voke to spirit , but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence.

Parl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance.
Hef spoken to him she would not speak again.
Hester print went one day to the mansion of Governor Belling Ham with a pair of bloves which she had frnged and emboidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused the sformer ruler to descend a step for two from the highest rank he still held and honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy.
Another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves inpelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the suttlement.
At that epic of pristine simplicity , however , matters of even slighter public interest and a less intrinsic weight than the welfare of Hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state.
The period was hardly at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature.
We have spoken of pearl's rich and luxjoriant beauty , a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints , a bright complexion , eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black.
It was the scarlet letter in another form , the scarlet letter dowled with life.
the mother herself as if the red ignomine were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions of a soned its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid genuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture.
But in truth , for all was one as well as the other and the only inconsequence of that identity had haster contrive so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance.
come therefore and let us sling mud at them.
But Perl , who was a dauntless child after frowning , stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures , suddenly made a rush at the not of her enemies and put them all to flight.
She screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them.
It was further decorated with strange and seemingly capolistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when laid on and had now grown hard and doorable for the admiration of after times.
They approached the door which was in an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projecton of the adofice in both of which were latis windows with wooden shutters to close over them at needed
Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal , Hester Prin gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor 's bond servants , a free - born English man but now a seven - year old slave.
Yeah , he has honorable worship within , but he hath a godly minister or two with him and likewise alite.
Ye may not see his worship now.
With many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials , diversity of climate and different modes of social life , Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of Faras state in his native land.
On the table and tokened at the sentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind stood a large puter tankered at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it . They might have seen the frothy rumnant of a recent draft of Aile.
little pearl , who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering front piece of the house , spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate.

and in reality she seemed absolutely hidden behind it.
Fearl accordingly ran to the bowindow at the further end of the hall and looked along the viste of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and invetor attempt at shrubery.
but the proprietor appeared already to have reelinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the Atlantic in a hard soil and , amid the close struggle for subsistence , the native English taste for ornamental gardening.
There were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees , probably the descendents of those planted by the reverend Mister Blackstone , the first settler of the penincula , that half - mithological personage who rides through our early annals seaded on the back of a ball.
Pearl saw the rose bushes and began to cry for our red rose and would not be passified.
He had blue silk stockings , blue nee pans with gold buckles , a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braded with gold.
His hat had a peaked crown with a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved.
Instead of shoes , the old man wore boots with turnover tops and a blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid.
For a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful in which they lived.
When they were outside , , they simply laphed the door and started up the path.
No one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone.
At the foot of the mountain that separates the country of the monchkins from the country of the gillickans the path was divided.
He knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbour.
All morning they trudged up the mountain path and next unk and Ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket.
Then they started on again and two hours later came the sight of the house doctor pipped.
all conocted the door of the house and a chubby pleasant - faced woman dressed in Lin blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile.
I am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home.
We have come from a alone place than this place.
and you must be unlucky , she added.
Oh Jo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life.
where travelling replied Ojo and les stoff it your house just to rest and werefresh ourselves.
The woman seemed thoughtful.
At one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row , all bubbling and steaming at a great rate.
It takes me several years to make this magic powder , but at the moment I am pleased to say it is nearly done . You see , I am making it for my good wife , Margaralot , who wants to use some of it for the purpose of her own.
You must know said Margalot when they were allseated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old Mumbe the witch who used to live in the country of Te gillikins to the north of here.
The first picture we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since.
I think the next glass cat then magician will have neither brains nor heart because then it will not object to catching Mise and they will prove of some use to us.
I am fraid I don't know much about the land us.
yousee I have lived allmy life with a nonkey the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything.
That is one reason you are unlucky , said the woman in a sympathetic tone.
I think I must show you my patchwork girl , said Margalout , laughing at the boys ' ostonishment for she is rather difficult to explain.
But first I will tell you that for many years I have longed for a servant to help me with the housework work and to prepare the meals and wash the dishes.
yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose.
A bed quilt is made of patches of different kinds and colours of cloth together.
Sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up.
When I found Id I said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl , for when she was brought to life , she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is , for such a dreadful mixture of colours would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchgins are.
In the emerald city where our princess alsimalives green is the popular color.
I will show you what a good job I did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.
Oh Jo wexamined this carious contrivance with wonder.
Margalot had first made the girls form from the patch work quiled and then she dressed them with the patch work skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same game material throughout.
The head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her.
The hair was af brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat brains.
Gold is the most common metal in the land of OS and is used for many purposes because it is soft andpliable.
No I forgot and about the brains , exclaimed the woman.
Well , that may be true , agreed Margaloc , but on the contact a service with two many brains as sure to become de pendent in high and mighty and feel above her work.
She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.
I think that will continue because the other qualities that are not needed in the servant.
She ran to her husband 's side at once and helped him lift the fore cattle from the fire.
their contents had all boiled away , leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder.
very carefully , the magician removed this powder , placing it alltogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon.
No one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life , but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and went back to the cupboard.
Oh Jo became a bit uneasy at this , for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish , but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness.
He selected a small gold bottle with a pepperbox on top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes.
Most people talk too much , so it is a relief to find one who talks too little.
I am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement , he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe with a crookin stem and began to smoke.

The grateful applause of the clergy has consequated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest.
The edict of Milane , the great charter of toleration , had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion.
But this inestimable privilege was soon violated . With a knowledge of truth , the emperor embibe the maxims of persecution and the sex which dissented from the Catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of Christianity.

Some of the penal regulations were copied from the articles of dicletion and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who have fell the hand of appression and pleated for the rights of humanity.
They asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the opostolical succession was interrupted , that all the bishops of the ourope and Asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the perogatives of the Catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the African believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline.

The eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed.
It would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding.
see said unchas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him , the dark hair had gone toward the forest.
If a rock or a rivilat or a bit of earth harder than comman severed the links of the clue , they followed the true eye of the scout , recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary.
extinguished brands were lying around a spring , the awfuls of a dear were scattered about the place and the trees wore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses.
A circle of a few hundred feet of sircumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion.
The examination , however , resulted in no discovery.
The whole party crowded to the spot where uncaspointed out the impression of a mocuson in the moist illuvion.
run back on coston brought me the size of the singer's foot.
Notwithstanding the high resolution of howkay , he fully comprehended all the difficulties and dangers he was about to encur.
In his return to the camp , his acute and practiced intellects were intently engaged in divising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree in ferior to his own.
In other words , while he had implicit faith in the ability of bailem's to speak , he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs.
There was something in his air and demanner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind.
The ingenious hawky who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation.
The bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well - known voice replied.
Can these things be returned to david breathing more freely as the truth begins to down upon him.
Come com return Hocki and see his honest countenance , the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion , you may see a skin which , if it is not as white as one of the gentle ones , has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business.
The young man is in bondage and I fear his death will be decreed.
I greatly morned that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and I have sought a goodly message . Can you lead me to him.
The task will not be difficult , David hesitating , though I greatly fear your presence would rather mitigate his unhappy fortunes.
The lodgein which uncus was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation.
Four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison uncus wary but close observers of the manner of their captive.s
delivered an astrong tone of a cent announced the gratification the savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared.
They drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter.
but the bear , instead of obeying , maintained the seat he had taken and growled.
The cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow up on his brothers and take away their courage too . Continued david , improving the hand he received , they must stand further off.
Then , as if satisfied with their safety , the scout left his position and slowly entered the place.
It was silent and gloomy , being tenanted solely by the captive and lit by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cooquery.
Onkus occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude , being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful withs.
The scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
What shall we do with the mingoes at the door ? They count six and the singer is as good as nothing.
The delawares are children of the tortise and they outstrippe the deer.
oncus , who had already approached the door and was readiness to lead the way , now recoiled and placed himself once more at the bottom of the lodge.
but Hawk y , who was too occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement , continued speaking more to himself than to his companion.
So Onchus , you had better take the lead while I will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed.
Well , what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention.
As soon as these dispositions were made , the scout came to daven and gave him his parting instructions.
My pursuits are peaceful and my temper I humbly trust as greatly given to mercy and love returned David a little nettle that is so direct and attack on his menhood , but there is none who can say that I have ever forgotten my faith in the lord , even in the greatest straits.
If you are not then knocked on the head , your being a non - compasor will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed.
So choose for yourself to make a rush or terry here.
bravely and generously has battled on my behalf and this and more will I dare in his service.
keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out seddenly and one of your shouting which will serve to remind the Indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be.
If however , they take your scoup as I trust them and believe they will not depend on it and I will not forget the deed , but revenge as become true warriors and trusty friends.
Hold said David , prceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him . I am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge.
Then heving a heavy sigh , probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned . He added it is what I would wish to practice myself as one without a cross of blood , though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian.
God bless you friend . I do believe your send is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping a turnity before the eyes , though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation.
The Delaware dog , he said , leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expressions of the other features is afraid.
will the herens hear his groans.
The moheacan started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort.
He had no occasion to delay , for at the next instant a burst of chries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village.
ongess cast a skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.
I will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned.
I had always known him to be restless in his manner , but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrol belegitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred.
My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker 's street.
Without his scrapbooks , his chemicals and his homely antidiness he was an incomfortable man.
I had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct.
I was absent for more than an hour.
The only dupikat which existed so far as I knew it was that which belonged to my servant banister , a man who had looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty was absolutely above suspicion.
The moment I looked at my table , I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers.
The proof was in three long slips I had left them all together.
What it all turned out was that someone passing had observed the key in the door , had known that I was out and had entered to look at the papers.
I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair . I made the most careful examination of the room.
A broken tip of led was lying there also.
Not only this , but on the table I found a small ball of black do or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
Above all things , I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.
To the best of my belief , they were rolled up.
Did anyone know that these proofs would be there if no one saved the printer.
I was in such a hurri to come to you . You left your door open.
So it seems to me.
Now Mister sulmbs at your disposal.
above wore three students , one on each story.
Then he pproached it and , standing on tipto with his neck craned , he looked into the room.
There is no opening except the one paitine said our learned guide.
I am afraid there are no signs here , said
One could hardly hope for any upon such an ordinary day.
You left him in a chair you say , which is next to the window there.
The man entered and took the papers shed by shet from the central table.
As a matter of fact , he could not say solmes because I entered by the side door.
How long it takes to do that using every possible contraction is about an hour , not less.
Then he tassed it down and seized the next.
He was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat , very hurried since he had had no time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.
Mister Salmas was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.
homs held out a small chip with the letters an an and the space of clear wood after them you see.
What's a ni has always done you and injustice , there are others.
I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin , some trace of it might come through upon this polishe surface . I saw nothing.
As homes drew the curtain , I was aware from some little regidity and anlertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency.
Holms turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor . Hello what is this.
home hut ed out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.
What could he do ? He caught up with everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.
I understand you say that there are three students who use this stare and are in the habit of passing your door . Yes there are.
and they are all in for the examination yes.
One really likes to throw suspicion where there is no proofs.
Let us he the suspicions . I will look after the proofs.
My scholar has been left very poor , but he is hard - working and industrious , he will do well.
The top floor belongs to males mcclerin.
I do not go so far as that , but of the three , he is perhaps the least unlikely.
He was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life.
but I have occasionally done the same thing at other times.
Did you look at these papers on the table.
How came you left the key in the door.
Someone in the room could get out , yes sir.
I really don't think he knew much about it , Mister Holmes.
only for a minute or so.
Oh , I would not venture to say sir.
You haven't seen any of them no sir.
It was the Indian whose dark silouett appeared suddenly upon his blind.
He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.
The set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them.
No names , please said Holmes , as we knocked at Gilchris 's door.
Of course , he did not realize that it was y who was nocking but nonetheless his conduct was very uncourteous and , indeed , under the circumstances , rather suspicious.
That is very important in homes.
You don't seem to realize the position.
to morrow as the examination.
I ca n't allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with . The situation must be faced.
It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.
I will take the black clar with me and the pennil cuttings . Goodbye bye.
When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle , we again looked up at the windows.
the fou moute fellow at the top.
He is the one with the worst record.
Why benister the servant what's his game in the matter.
He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.
My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation.
No good my dear Watson.
I think you have formed a conclusion.
Yes my dear Watson , I have solved the mystery.
look at that he held out his hand.
On the palms were three little pyramids of black dohy clay.
and one more this morning.
In a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the colprit to compete for the valuable scholarship.
He could hardly stand still , so great was his mental egitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched , thinking heaven that you have come.
You know him , I think so.
If this matter is not to become public , we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial.
No sir , certainly not.
There was no man sir.
His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon the banister and the farther corner.
just close the door said homes.
We want to know , Mister Gilchrist , how you and an honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday.
For a moment , Gil Christ , with an upraised hand , tried to control his riving features.
Come come said holme's kindly , it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.
Well , I'll not answer , listen and see that I do you know and justice.
He could examine the papers in his own office.
Hindian I also thought nothing of.
When I approached your room , I looked at the window.
No one less than that would have a chance.
I entered and I took you into my confidence as to these suggestions for the side table.
He returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are where , with several sharp spikes.
No harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he prceived the keey which had been left by the carelessness of your servant.
A sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs.
He put his shoes on the table.
gloves , said the young man.
Suddenly , he heard him at the very door . There was no possible escape.
Hove I told the truth Mister Gilgrust.
I have a letter here Mister Solmes which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night.
It would be clear to you from what I have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you got out.
It was simple enough sir , if you only had known , but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know.
If Mister Solm saw them , the game was up.
In the debate between the singiers societies , her defense of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm.
the South she had not thought of seriously and yet , knowing of its delightful hospitality and miled climate , she was not verse in Charleston or New Orleans.
John Taylor , who had supported her through college , was interested in cotton.
better go he had counseld antentiously.

But John there's no society , just elementary work.
been looking up toomb's county.
Fine some crustwells there big plantations raded it two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Some others also bid cottond county.
I ought to know John if I teach Negroes , else I scarcely see many people in my own class.
At any rate , I say go.
Here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused oldors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable.
She wonted a glance at the new books in periodicals and talked of great ful anthropies and reforms.
So for the hundredh times she was thinking today as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms.
cotton she bassed.
She had almost forgotten that it was here with in touch and sight.
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her sretching awit to the northward.
It must be a bit poor here and there , but most of this place was such desperate prose.
Her regards shifted to the green stocks and leaves again and she started to move away.
Cotton is a wonderful thing , is it not boyse allowed allowed allowed ? she said rather primly.
Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton , but at least one more remark seemed called four.
do know about all the things in wouldly commented Miss Taylor 's letter re Bornin cotton and well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go.
I suppose , though it's too early for them , then came the explosion.
Googles don't grow on top of sadvines but on the ground of new ords like yems
The golden fleece is the silver fleece he harkened.
Sometimes you tell me , please won't you.
Now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy . , not even a mat . She had been talking , just talking . There were no people in the conversation , just things one thing taughtme.
The honorable Chales Smith , Miss Sara's brother , was walking swiftly and down from Mister Easterley's wallstreet office and his face was pale.
Finally , the cotton combine was , to all appearances in assured fact and he was slated for the senate.
Why should he not be like other men.
She was not herself a notably intelligent woman . She greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others.
As she awaited her guess she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and as quiet tude for her social functions were few at night there . She checked them off on her fingers , Sir James Criton , the Rich English menufacturer and Lady Criton Mister and Missus Vanderpol Mister Harry Creswell an hiss sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guess that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of coden interests earlier in the day.
Missus Gray had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind their cruelty to poor negroes , a subject she made a point of introducing fourth
She was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear Mister Crestwell express himself so cordially as approving of Negro education.
Do you believe in some education ? asked Mary Taylor.
I believe in training people to their capacity . The Englishmen here hartily seconded him.
but Creswell added significant copacity in normous li between racees.
The bandor pools were sure of this and the Englishman instancing India became quite eloquent . Missus Gray was mistified but hardly dared admit . The general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest crutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them.
Wals a Timley , her aunt , added criswell avoiding her sisters ' eyes.
but we're not exactly welcome.
Marry Taylor , however , related the tail of Sor to Missus Gray's private ear later.
For example , , Mister Vanderfol nor her nose and sawtinors all ribing at a belof mutual understanding on most of these matters.
He knew the silver clothes his ansor must be ruined.
It was the first great sorrow of his life . It was not so much the loss of the cottin itself but the fantasy that whopes the dreams built around it.
Ah the swamp , the cruel swamp.
The revelation of his love lit and brightened slowly until it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder.
He panted to know if she too knew or knew and cared not or cared and knew not.
She was so strange an human accreature.
The world was water beiled in mists.
Then if it was suddenly autumn day , the sun shot out hod and still no breath of air stirred . The sgy was like lue steel , the earth steamed.
Where was the use of imagining.
The lagood had been level with the dikes a week ago and now.
Perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping.
He started at the thought , he hurried forth sadly.
He plashed to stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the ramp of the clearing and put his foot upon the tree bridge.
Then he looked down , the lagoon was dry.
He stood a moment , bewoldered , then turned and rushed upon the eisland A great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green tall , wet and willowy.
The squares of codd a sharp edge were just about to burst into bulls.
But one long moment he paused stupid again with utter amazement , then lane dizzly against the tree.
He gazed about bleced astonished.
Here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain . Someone had dug a now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and cocked way , thus allowing it to empty directly.
He sat down weak the wildered and one thought was up er most soara.
The year she died was ten.
The hope and dream of harvest was upon the land.
up in the sick roomes or lay on the little white bed.
The ned and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her . She had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strole for her life wosh narled and creeping fingers , but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned.
For a while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure , son and bird and tree.
She , with a fleeting glance , gathered the shawl around her then glided forward , the wavering tremulus slipped across the road and into the swamp.
She had been born within its borders , within its border , she had lived in groan and within its border she had met her love.
She hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton laborfore her.
The chair was empty but he knew.
He darted through the trees and pawsed a tall man strongly but slimly made.
It is a very fine old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery liken which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables , the windows and the door
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door , I think , is like a gate it is never opened.
for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonrous bang behind the livery blackey who had just seen as master and misters off the grounds in a carriage and par.
a large open fireplace with resty dogs in it and a barer boarded floor at the far end , fleeces of wolves sbacked up in the middle of the floor some empty cornbags.
and what through the left hand window.
Several clothes morses , a pillion , a spenning wale and an old box opened and stuffed full of coloured rags.
At the edge of this box there is a great wooden doll which , so far as mudilation is concerned , bears a strong resemblance to the finest Greek sculpture and , especially in the total loss of its nose.
The history of the house is plain now.
but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the couch and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow billed ducks who are seasing the opportunity of gitting the grink with as much body in it as possible.
were the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harnesses under the superintendents of Mister Goby , the woddaw otherwise satdler who entertains them with the latest tredleston gassap.
Hathe Surl often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned to look at the pleacing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for arnament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round peterdishes there were ranged on the shells above the long deal dinner table or in the hobs of the great which always shone like jasper.
Do not suppose , however , that Missus poyser was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a good looking woman , not more than eight and thirty , with a fair complexion and sandy hair , short shapen light feet .
The family like this between her and her knees Dina Moris , with a contrast between her keenness and Dinas ' strange gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary.
Her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a dame sol came with ag or shot it seemed to take up an unfinished luxury as a barrel organ takes up a tune perecisely at the point where it had left off.
The fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the wid ows and why , I , consequently , missus poiser should scold molly the house with unusual severity.
To all appearance , Molly had got through her after dinner work in an exemplary manner , had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissivly if she should sit down to her spinning till miltingtime.
spinning indeed.
I never knew your equals for gallowsness. .
who taught you to scrub a floor would like to know.
comb the wolf for the wio ows indeed.
That's what she'd like to be doing
That's the way with you . that's the road you'd all like to go headlongs to ruin.
Mister Oat Lees andeed.
You are a rare ind sitting down at your work a little while after it 's time to put by.
My alarm told us to put it down to warm.
cald es it my darling , bless your sweet face.
She's going to put the ironing things away.
I decided to go into the barn to Tomme to see the odd.
no no no tadty bitter feet wet said Missus poyser , carrying away her iron.
Did anybody see the screaming Missus poyser running towards the table when her ei had fallen on the blue stream.
Toddy , however , had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of wabbling run and an amount of fat on the neieb of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig.
and she was very fond of you too , Rechel.
I often heard her talk about you and the same sort of way.
which he had that big illness and I was only leven years old . She used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt Rachel if I'm taken from you because she has a kind heart and I'm sure I've found it so.
and there's linden in the house as I could well spare you because I got lots of sheeting and table clothing and towling isn't made up.
but not more than what's in the bible , said Dina.
mader and you never heard me say that all people are called to her sake their work in their families.
We can all be servants of God wherever our lot is cast , but he gives us different sorts of work the cording as he fits us for it and us for it.
I can no help spending my wife trying to do what I can for the souls of others . Then you could help running if you heard little Toddy crying at the other end of the house . The voice would go to your heart . You would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her.
I am strong as surents that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children or anything I have done.
I didn't preach without direction.
direction.
I had common patience with you.
By this time the two men had reached the palings and had got off of their horses . He was playing , they meant to come in.
said Mister Irwin with his stately cordiality.
o ser dot mention it said miti's poycer.
I live in your kitchen.
The poiser is not at home is he.
said Captain Danny Thorne , sitting by himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door.
No Sir he isn't . He's gone to Roseter to see Mister West the factor about the world .
but their father was in the barn , if he'd be of any use.
No thank you . I'll just look at the welbs and leave a message about them with your shepherd.
I must come another day and see your husband . I want to have a consultation with him about horses.
for If he is anywhere on the farm , we consend for him in a minute.
Oh Sir said Missus poyser rather larmed you wouldn't like it at all.
But you know more about that than I do sir.
I think I should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place.
I knowce Marm is in better order than any other with ten miles of us than as for the kitchen , he added , smiling . I don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it.
By the way , I've never seen your diary . I must see your diary Missus poyser.
This misus poisor said , blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her melt pans and would ad just his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy.
Oh , have no doubt it's in capital order.

There Messier's Johnson and Hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in art and secured useful data for the work in New York of which the story has just been told.
The dynamo electric machine bot small was robust for under all the variing speeds of waterpower and the pecissitudes of the plant to which it belonged . It continued in active use until eighteen ninety - nine seventeen years.
Owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers , a son has been frequently spoken of as an annaponent of the alternating course
Why if we erect a station at the falls , it is a great economy to get it up to the city.
There seems no good reason for believing that it will change.
broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them , he is pidyo actually supposed to loosen waste methods to plans e vempire that neglect the poor at the gate.
Everything he has done has been amed at the concervation of energy , the contraction of space , the intensification of culture.
For some years , it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against seriously.
It could not be used for electoral plating or deposition nor could it charge to rige batteries , all of which are easily within the ability of the directurrent.
but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb , a group of dwellings on the outskirts of remote country resevens or a far mouse the alternating currents in all elements save its danger was and is ideal.
Isson was tolerant of shamm on Shaddi and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope tube and galvanometer.
Unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exact government regulated than those available for his dinamo and lamp at ason realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light.
Mister Addison was a leader far ahead of the time.
He obtained the desired speed and loaded with a friction break , also a regulator of speed , but waited for an indicator to verify it.
Then again , there was no way to lupricate an engineer for continuous running and Mister Edison and formed me that as marine engines started before the ship left New York and continued running until it reached its home port , so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times.
Andison had installed his historic first great central station system in New York on the multiple arch system covered by his feeter and main invention , which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against the straight to wire system throughout the tree
He soon foresaw that still greater aconomy would be necessary for commercial success , not only for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities.
The strong position held by the Edison's system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and et gave an immediate empothus to incondicent lighting.
It was particularly suited for a trial plant also in the early days when the yield of six or eight lamps to the horse bower was considered subject for congratulate
The street conductors were of the overhead poll lime construction adwar stalled by the construction company that had been organized by adison to build equipped entrance stations.
Meanwhile , he had called upon me to make a report of the three weird system known in England as the Hopkinson . Both Doctor John Hopkinson and Mister Edison are independent and vendors at practically the same time.
I think he was perhaps more appreciative than I was of the discipline of the Edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up.
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country.
They were later used as reserve bachines and finally , with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edesonia but they remain in practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty three.
The arc labp and stalled outside a customers ' premises or in a circuit for public streetlighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lap might be out through an accident.
Evison held that electricity should be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter.
There was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other invettors were also giving the subject bherthought the public took it for granted that any thing so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weded and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration.
Hence , the adison electoralitic meter is no longer used despite its axcellent qualities.
The principale employed in the adison electoralitic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to deacompose a chemical substance.
associated with the simple form of apparatus were various genious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation , freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit thaft of current or damage.
The standard adison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination . Another set being substituted.
In December eighteen eighty eight Mister Duw j Jecks read an interesting paper before the American Institute of electrical Engineers on the six years of practical experience he had up to that time with the meter , then more generally in use than any other.
The others have been an operation too short a time to show definite results , although they also went quickly to a dividend basis.
In this connection , it should be mentioned that the association of adison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the adnison mader was accurate and that it's use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were in variably secured an a station selling current by meter.
The meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety - nine and probably up to the close of the century.
He waiged at rewave the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable , but all in vain.
He felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suggest better
The problem was solved.
We were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part.
We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.
Here she would stay comforted by ed and soothed by the lovely plants and richardxotics rejoicing the heart of old turn at the gardener who , since poulysfirst raptrous entrance , had taken her into his good graces for all time.

Then dear said Missus , you must be more kind to her more than ever think what it would be f for one of you to be away from home , even among friends.
Somehow of all the days when home feeling strong , this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
But she could only see fhranzie for just one moment.

At this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped fronsye. came

Oh you are the dearest unbest mister king I have ever seen , but how did you make mammy let her come.
Isane splendid cried jasper and intense pride swelling up . Father knew how to do it.
There there he said , soothingly patting her brown blus head.
I gasped polly andtrolling her sobs . I won't only I ca thank you.
asked Franzie and her intense interests , slipping out of poly's arms and crowding up close to Jasper's side.
Yes , all alone by himself , asserted jasper beemently and winking periously to the others to stop their laughing , he did now truly probably

Ber japp you've got it lapped percy while the other screamed at beside of jasper space.
don't mind it . Polly whispered Jasper was her fault.
Dear me jaculated the old gentleman and the utmost amazement and such a time I have had to get her here too.
How did her mother ever let her go.
She asked impulsively . I didn't believe she could persuade her father.
I did have any fears if I worked too seriously , said the old gentleman complacently.
He cried and highe dudgeen just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his mancy.
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time.
At last , he came out of them and wiped his face vigerously.
It was sixteen years ago , John Burk died.
His wife now lies beside him and the lhight shaft that marked their graves bleams across the wheat fields.

He was a splendid figure of a boy talm and straight as a young pine tree with his handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow.
That's not much of a job for an athlete here . I've been to Detown and back.

She gathered up her reins.
Please wait for me Marie Amiel Tokes.
I have never seen loose over here.
how brown you've got since you came home . I wished I had an atlate to Mammy orchard.
I get wet to my knees when I go down to pic carries.
Indeed , he had looked away with the purpose of noxseing it.
They think you are proud because you've been away from school or something.
There was something unique about the great farm , a most unusual trimness and care for detail.

A breafh win had come up and was driving puppy white clouds across the sky.
The article resparkling and rippling in the sun.
That invitation made her.
Oh , but I'm glad to get this place mod.
Just smell the wild roses . They are always so spicy after arrain.
We never had so many of them in hare before.
I suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them too.
I suppose that's what too then.
It includes everything growing until faft and getting the grass cut.

In a few moments , he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swing his sih with that long stroke that the least American boys ever learned.
Myri picked up Jherrius and said softly to herself , stripping one glittering ranch after another , shivering when she thought a show r op rain dropps on her neck and hair.
and Amial made his way slowly down toward the cherry trees.
That summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than Shabata and his men could do to heep up with the corn . The orchard was a neglected wilderness.
I don't know all of them but I know Zar.
If I feel that way , I feel that way.
He reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet incipid fruit , long ivery coloured barries tipped with maint pink like white carrel that fell to the ground unheeded all summer through.
He dropped a handful into her lap.
Yes don't you.
Oh ethers a lot , only he seems kind of a school teachery.
When she used to tell me about him , I always wondered whether she was n't a little in love with him.
It would serve you all right if she walked off with carl.
I liked to talk to Carl about New York and what a fellow can do there.
oh amiel.
surely you are not thinking of going off there.
Mariese bace falls under his brooding gaze.
I am sure Hi Tats Andra hopes you will stay on here , she murmured.
I don't want to stay around at dawn.
I want to be doing something on my own account.
Sometimes I don't want to do anything at all and sometimes I want to pull the three corners of the devide together . He threwhout his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a table cloth.
I got tired of seeing men and horses going up anddown up down
I wish you weren't so rettless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sad
Thank you . He returned shortly. after
and you never used to be a prosse to me.
I can't play with you like a little boy and and more , he said slowly , that's what you miss Marie.
But Amiel , if I understand all our good times are over , we can never do nice things together any more.
Anyway , there's nothing to understand.

I pray for you but it is not the same as if you pray yourself.
I ca pray to have the things I want , he said slowly , and I won't pray not to have them not if I'm damned for it.
but all our good times are over.
Saturday August fifteen the sea broke in all round , no land in sight.
The horizon seemed extremely distant.
Ol my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him , but now that I am well , nature has resumed its sway.
You seem anxious my uncle , I said , seeing him continually with his glass to his eye
One might be less reason than now.
I have not complaiting that the rat is slow but that the seat is so wide.
We are losing time and the fact is I have not come all this way to take a little saile upon a person on a raft.
He called the sea apo and I took a little sail.
Therefore , don't talk to me about my views and prospects.
I take this as my auntswer and I leave the professor to buite his lips with impatience.
Sunday , August sixteenth.
Nothing knew whether the wind was was
but there seemed no reason to fear.
The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined on the surface of the waves.
Truly , the sea is of infinite wit.
It must be as wide as the mediterranean Atlantic and why not.
These thoughts additated me all day in my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleeve.
I shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance.
I saw at the hamburger museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length.
I suppose professor Leadon Brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears after having examined the pig 's eyes ferse the ocean from side to side
day August eighteenth.
During his watch I slept.
Two hours afterwards , a terrible shock struck me.
tho wraft was headed up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms.
there's a whale awale cried the professor.
fight was out of the question . Now the reptiles rose they willed around our little raft with a repidity greater than that of expressed trads.
Two monsters only recreating all this commotion and before my eyes are rephiles of the primitive world.
I can distinguish the eye of the ictheassourus glowing like a red hot co and his large as a man's head.
it'ss jaw is normous and , according to naturalists , is arned with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth.
Those huge creatures attack each other with the greatest animosity.
Suddenly , the icteossourus and the plecius sourus disappear , leaving a war poll eddiing in the water.
As for the assourus , he returned whose submarine Cabern.
The rowings last in the distance.
The weather , if we may use the term , will change before the lawn.
The atmosphere is charged with vapors prvaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters.
The electric light con scarcely penetrates through the dence curn which is dropped over the theatre in which the battle of the elements is about to be waged.
The air is heavy , the sea is calm.
From time to time , a flicy toufh of mise with some gleaming light left upon it trop down upon the dence floor of gray and loses itself in the ophag and a peneterable mass.
The atmosphere is evidently charged and the water charged by the lectricity.
The wind always lolls but to acquire increased strength , the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts in rushing storms.
There's a heavy storm coming on . I cried , pointing towards the horizon.
Those clouds seemed as if they were going to crush the sea.
on the mast already I see the light play of a lamin saint will'sfire the outstritch saile catches a breadth of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead.
But if we have now ceased to advance , how do we leave that sale loose which at the first shock of a tempest mecapsize us in a moment.
That will be the safety no no never.
The pold of vapors in water and the air put in violet action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a wirldwin.
harnsters not.
From the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid life . Electric matter is in continual evolution from its component molicules and gashes . elements of the air need to be slaved with moisture for innermable columns of water to rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam.
I referred to the thermometer . It indicates the figure is bliteratedg.
is the atmosphere having once reached the stensity to become finel.
The raft is still to the southeast.
At noon , the violence of the storm redoubled.
Each of us is lashed to some part of the raft.
The waves rise above our heads.
It seemed to be we were lost , but I am not sure.
He nods his consent.
The far ball , half of it wide , half azere blue and the size of a ten inch shell , moved soly about the raft but revolving on its own acess with thestonishing philocity as if whipped round by the force of the worlwind.
Here it comes there it glides . Now it is up the ragged stump of the mast . It lightly leaps on the provision bag , descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine orrible.
We shall be blown up , but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside . It approaches harns who fixes his blue eye upon its sedily it threatens the head of my uncle , who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it.
A suffocating smell of nigtroted fills the air . It enters the throat and it fills the longs.
We suffer stifling pains.
and how odd the directions will look.
poor ouice.
It was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed in a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other . He came trotting along and in a great hurry mutdering to himself as he came oh the Duchess the Duchess.
Oh how she would have survived if I've had kept her waiting.
I took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept panning herself all the time . She went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to today .
and yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've changed in the night.
I think I can remember feeling a little different.
I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
I shall never get to twenty at that rate.
how cheerfully he seems to grin , how neatly spread the clause and welcome the offiches in with gently smiling jaws.
No , I'd made up my mind about it . If I ca , I'll stay down here.
yiu'll be no use them putting their heads down and singing coming up again dear.
I am so very tired of being all alone here.
and I declare it's too bad that it is.
I wish I hadn't cried so much , said Alice as she swam about trying to find her way out.
I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being trowned in my own tears.
That will be a queer thing to be sure.
I am very tired of swimming about here oh mouse.
cried aliceagain for this time the mouse was prsling all over her and she felt certain it must be really offended.
We won't talk about her any more if he'd rather not we
We want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general American market . Will you do it.
The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk to Americans streamline him , so to speak , because you will never get people , whether in or outside the lutheran church , actually to read Luther and less we will talk like you would talk to today to Americans.
Let us begin with his commentary ongalations.
The undertaking which seemed so attractive when biewed as a literary task proved the most difficult one and at times became a precsive.
It was written in Latin.
The work had to be condensed.
A word should now be said about the origin of Luther's commentary ungulations.
Much later , when a friend of his was preparing an addition of all his Latin works , he remarked to his home circle that if I had my way about it , they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine mygelations fornstance.
In other words , these three men took the lecures which lutheradressed to their students in the course of galations and prepared the manuscript for the printer.
It presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of Christianity , the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ 's merits alone.
but the essence of luther's lectures is there.
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear , let him also give us power to serve and to do lop to.
The word of our god shall stand forever.
In every way , they sought to undermine the authority of Saint Paul.
They said to the galations you have no right to think highly ofppaul.
He was the last aturned of crist.

Indeed , he persecuted the church of Christ for a long time.
Do you suppose they god for the sake of a few moothren heretics would thes emone their entire church.
Against these boasting false apostles , Paul boldly defense his apostolic authority in ministry.
As the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person , so the minister of Christ should exult his office in order to gain a uthority among men.
paltics proud of his ministry not to his own praise but to the prize of God.
Paul and a postle not of men et cetera.
Either he calls ministers through the agency of men or ecalse them directly as he called the profits apostles.
pald the clars of the false apostles were called hersent neither by men nor by man.
The most they could claim is that there were semply others.
He mentioned the apostles first because they were appointed direct by God.
The call was not to be taken lightly.
For people , possessing knowledge is not enough.
is spoils one's best work.
When I was a young man , I thought Paul was making too much of his call.
I did not then realize the importance of the ministry.
I knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught a fistrene set of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting.
This is no sinful pride , it is wholly pride.
in God the father who raised him from the dead.
The classemed superfulous on first sight.
These pervertors of the righesness of Christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both.
In this whole pestle paultreats of the resurrection of Christ.
By his resurrection , Crist won victory over the law , sin , the fleshworld , the devil , death , hell in every evil.

and all the breth rooms which are with me.
This should go far and shetting them mouse of the fals apostles.
Although the brethrin with me are not a position like myself , they are all in one mind with me , think right and teach as I do.
They do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate . They go where the cuestions are.
Why did they not invade the Catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to God 's princes , bishops and doctors as we have done with the help of God.
We look for that reward which I have not seen nor ear heard or has entered into the heart of man.
Not all the galations had become prverted.
These means cannot be contaminated.
They remained divine regardless of men's opinion.
Wherever the means of grac are found , there is the holy church even though anti crise reins there.
so much for the title of the epistole now follows the greeding of the apostlee verse three.
Grace be you and peace from God the father and from our bord Jhesus Christ.
The terms of grace and peace are common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood.
the greating of the apostles prefreshing.
Grace involves the remission of sins , peace and a happy conscience.
The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.
Experience proves this.
However , the grace and piece of God will.
Men should not speculate about the nature of God.
was it not enough to say from god the father.
To do so is to lose god altogether , because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and comprehend his infinite majesty. .
He came down to earth , lived among men , suffered , was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him.
embrace him and forget about the nature of God.
did not crist himself say I am the way of the truth and the life . No man comes unto the father but by me.
When you argue about the nature of God apart from the question of justification , you may be as profound as you like.
We are to hear Christ has been appointed by the father as our divined teacher.
At the same time , palkanfirms creed that Christ is very god.
That Christmas is very god is apparent in that Paul scribes to him divine powers equally with the father , , for instance , the power spense grace and peace.
To bestow peacing grace lies in the province of God , who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot.
Otherwise , Paul should have written grace from God the father and peace from our bord Jesus Christ.
The Arians took chice as a noble and perfect religion , superior even to the angels , because by him , God created heaven and earth.
Mohammad also speaks highly of Christ.

He never loses sight of the purpose of his opistle.
not gold or silver or passial lambs or n angel but himself what four.

underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences.
How may we obtain temission of our sins.
pauliansers the man who is named Jesus Christ and the son of God gave himself for our sinse.
Since Christ was given for our sins , it stands to reason that they calnot be put away by our own efforts.
This sentence also defines our sins as great , so great in fact that the whole world could not make ammends for a single sin.
The greatness of the Ransom Christ of a god indicates this.
The vicious character of San is brought out by the words who gave himself to Sinse.
But we are careless . we make light of sin.
We think that by some little work or merri we can dismiss in.
This passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold in der sin.
This attitude springs from a false conception of sin . the conception that San is a small matter easily taken care of by good works , that we must present ourselves to God with a good conscience , that we must feel no sin before we may feel that Christ was given for our sense.
Satitude is universal , particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others.
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them.
On the other hand , we should not regard them as so terrible that we must despair.
He passes a bruptly from persons through ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers the people from the heavens to men from stronomy to physiology . He confuses rather does not distinguish subject into object first and final causes and dreams of two metrical figures lost in a flios of sense.
but the influence which I exercised upon besterity is partly to a misunderstanding.
In the supposed thoughts of this dialogue , the neo platinests found hidden meanings and connections with the Jewish and Christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite variante with the spirit of plato.
They were absorbed in his theology and where , under the minion of his name , while that which was truly great in truly correct ristic in him , his effort to realize in connecting ofstrections was not understood by them at all.
There is no danger of the mardern commentators on the temeas falling into the ibbisurdities of the new yo platnests.
In the present day , we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted by himself and by the contemporary history of thought.
The fancies of the neo pladnists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a taste of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the Christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own history .
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of potatoes and in spide they are apposed to him.
We do not know how Pla would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the totrillogis which he has expressly connected was ever present in his mind.
The dialogue is primarily concerned with animal creation , including under this term , the heavily bodies , and with man unly as one of the animals .
but he has not as yet fined this antemediate territory which lies between medicine and methematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in rinking feries of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul.
With heratlitis he acknowledges the perpetual flooks like an excageros he is served by the predominance of mine . Although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subdoing lite the pifigorians he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number.
Many , if not all , the elements of the private cretic philosophy are included in the timeas.
It is sprobable that the relation of the ideis to god or of God to the world was differently conceived by him at different times in his life.
The ideas also remained , but they have become types in nature forms of male animal spurts fishes.
The style and plen of the tomeis different greatly from the bad of any other of the platanic dialogues.
But plato does the same mastery over his instrument , which hakes imits in the fedres or simposium.
Nothing can exceed the beauty or arbe of the introduction in which he uses words in his accustomed manner.
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is holdi given up.
He could ride in one style but not in a another tan . The Greek language had not as yet meant fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena.
Hence , we find the same sort of quosin us in the temeos of plato which character arizes the philosophical poem of the cricious.
There is a tendency to slow an often a defect of ribhen The meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a grater use of epposition in more repetition than occurs in playtols earlier ritings.
Playtol had the command of his materials , which would have helped him to produce a perfect work of art.

but I would not speak at the time because I wanted to refresh my memory.
Then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment . First to me is when a natural philosopher , Whill , speaks of the origin of the world going down to the creation of men and then I shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost of fenan citizens are from the egyptian records spoke.
but already at the point of economic evolution and stating the emergence of the lady specialized consemption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength has begun to work out in a moreol ess celebrite system.
The utality of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivotive growth.
Such consumption of fals by women is mellion siddental to their work . It is a means to their continued labour and not to consemption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life.
With further advance and culchure this to be may change into a simple custom of a moreor less fregrous character , but whatever the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained , whether it be at a bu or a large conventionality , the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.
In the nature of things , lexuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class.
under the taboo saiden victels and more particularly , certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.
grenkiness and the other pathological consequences of the free ears of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become unerific as being a marke at the second remove of the superior stateus of those who are able to afford the indulgence.
It has even happened that the name for certain disease conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonum for noble or gentle.
The consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed at the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master.
With many quofifications with more quolifications as the patriarcal tradition has gradually weakened , the general routine is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters.
The objection , of course , presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household pereprenalia is an obvious exception to this area , but it will appear in the sequel . Dis ecception is much more obvious and substantial.
The custom of testiv gatherings probably ariginated on motives of commidiality and religion . These moatives are also present in late development , but they do not continue to be the soul motives.
There is a more alaborate system of ranking grates.
This de frentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequente inheritance of gentlity.
Many of these affiliated gentlemen of lisure are at the same time less men of substance in the right right , so that some of them are scarcely at all aether sonly partilly to be rated as vi carious consumers.
Se many of them , however , make up the retainers and hangers on of the patron may be classed as carious consumers without qualification.
Many of these , and also many of the others , are the strucracy of Listi grye having turned into a change to the people and more or less comprehensive group of carious consumers in the persons of their wifes and children , their servants retain ers et cetera.
The wearing of uniforms are liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and maveen be said to be an amark of servitude real incredible
The wearers of uniforms and liveries may be reftly divided into two classes . the free and the servine were the noble and the ignoble.
but the general distinction is not a tatter count to be overlooked.
So those officers which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble , such as government fighting hunting , the care of arms and cutrments and the like . In short , those switches may be classed as sustensibly predatory employment
I never , as in these cases , the menial service question has to deal directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting . It easily acquires a reflected onarific character.
the livery becomes obnoxious to all who are required to wear it.
In a general way , though not tollly nor consistently , these two groups coincide.
The dependent who was first delegated for these stuties was the wife or the chief wife and , as would be expected in the late development of the institution , when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarly performed gradually narrows , the wife remains the last.
but as we descemd the social scale , the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarous leasure in consumption devolve upon the wife alone.
In the communitys of western culture , this point is a present found among the low imiddle class.
If beautiful comfort is achieved and it is less portutous circumstance if it , it must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves through the great economic law of wasted effort.
The man of the household can also do something in this recession and indeed he commonly does , but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums . The man and presently also the children virtualy seize to consume valuable goods for apearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household pecuniaritecency.
very much of squallorand discomfort will be indured before the last trink et or the last pretence of pecunaritie is put away.
There is no class and no country that yielded so obviously before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need.
The question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the people whose comvictions it is desired to affect.
Each will serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth.
The mudernerganization of industry works in the same direction also by another line.
It is evident therefore that the present trend of development is in the diraktion of hihtening the utility of conspicous consumption as compared with leisure.
It is also noticable that the service possibility of consumption is a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where human contact with the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest.
Consemption becomes a larger element in the sander of living in the city than in the country.
among the country 's population , its places are to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighboring gossip sufficiently to serve the light general purpose of pecuniary repuit.
The result is a great mability of the labor imploint in printing , perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and comfortable buddy of workmen.
Under the simple test of affectiveness for advertising , we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consemption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary amulation pretty evenly from the outset.
But the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme . Leisure held first place at the start and came toold rank faramet above wasteful consumption of goods , both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceful culture.
are the circumstances permitting that instinct dispose men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use.
I reconciliation between the two conflict requirements is affected by resorting to making believs men and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed . Many organizations have been founded with some specious object of amiliration and bodied in their official styl entitle them much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the tack is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effect cial economic value of their traffic.
The sailent features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated.
Throughout the entire evolution of conspicious expenditure , whether of good sar of services or human life , , the obvious implication is that in order to affectually mend the consumer's good fame , it must be an expenditure of superfluities.
As used in the speech of everyday life , the word carries an undertone of depprecation.
The use of wood waste as a technical term therefore impries no deprecation of the motives or of the end' dessert by the constumer under this canon of conspicuous waste.
but it is another ground worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday daily life implies therprication of what characterizes a suastepull.
In strict accuracy , nothing should be included under the head of conspicious waste but such expenditure as his encured in the group of an invitious pecuniary comparison.
and articles may be useful in wastful both and their setelited to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions.
and often my mother said while on her lap I laid my head she feared for time I was not made but for my personality .
Whyare we denied each other in society.
Why are we divided.
Surely I must be , because we're in danger of loving each other too well , of losing sight of the creator and the idolotry of the creature.
We used to dispute about politics and religion.
Her Torian cleredymen's daughter was always in the minority in her house of violin discent and radicalism.
Her fewble health raised her her yielding manner for she could never oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle.
He spoke French perfectly , I've been told when needed , but delighted , usually talking the broadest Yorkshire.
and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and descenters into which twenty years ago the little quiet , resolute clergymen's daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honoured.
January and February of eighteen thirty seven had passed away and still there was no reply from the souvy.
I am not depreciating when I say that in these times it is not rare.
but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you con salt your own happiness.
You will say that a woman has no need for such caution . there can be no peril in it for her.
The more she is engaged in her proper duties , the more leisure will she have , even as an accomplishment and a recreation.
to those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity.
But do not suppose that I disparage the gift which you possess nor that I would discourage you from axercising it . I only exhort you to think of it and so to use it as to render it canducive to your own permanent good.
farewel madame.
Though I may be an ungracious advisor , you will allow me therefore to sescribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and here after your tur friend Robert Salthi.
Sir March Ixteenth.
I have not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone , so noble in its spirit.
I know the first letter I wrote to you wished all senselhiss trash from beginning to end , but I am not altogether the idle dreaming it would seem to denote.
I thought it was therefore my duty when I left school to become a governess.
In the evenings I confesse I do think , but I never trouble anyone else with my thoughts.
I carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and excentricity which might lead those I live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits.
I don't always succeed because sometimes when I'm teaching our sowing I would rather be reading writing , but I try to deny myself and my father at probation amply rewarded me for the provation.
Again , I thank you for this incident . I suppose it will be renewed no more . If I lived to be an old woman , I will remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream.
Pies prasser excused me for writing to you second time . I could not help writing , partly to tell you how thankful I am for your kindness , partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted . However sorffly and ereluctantly it may be at first followed b.
I cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting these repli.
Keswick Marche twenty second eighteen thirty - seven dear Madam
Your letter has given me great pleasure and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so.
of this second letter also she spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the lakes.
On August twenty seventh eighteen thirty seven she writes.
Come come I'm getting really tired of your absence.
The Saturday after Saturday came around and I had no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then I told that sister come oh dear.
In this monotonous life mind , that was a pleasant event.
I wash the ouwer back again , but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness and the instrangement of this long separation will wear away.
My eyes fell to tears when I translate the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state I now live in , uncertain that I will ever feel true contrition , wondering in thought indeed longing for holiness which I shall never never obtain smitonat times to the heart with the conviction that gasly calvinistic doctrines are true darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death.
If Christian perfection is necessary to selbation I shall never be saved . My heart is a very hot bed for sinful thoughts and when I decide on an action , I scarcely remember to look to my redemer for direction.
and meantime , I know the greatness of Jehova . I agknowledge the perfection of his word . I adore the purity of the Christian faith . My theory is right . my practice is horribly wrong.
The Christmas holidays came and she returned to the parsonage and to that happy home sircle in which alone their nature expanded amongst all other people they shriveled more or less.
Indeed , there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters would produce the same result.
She had gone out into the village on some errand . As she was descending down the steep street , her foot slipped on the ice and she fell . It was dark and no one saw her mistake till after a time , her grons attracted the attention of a passing by.
Unfortunately , the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.
However , remembering what you told me , namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision by the authors and that you are resolved to submit with resognation to that decision , whatever it might be , I hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent and may be all for the best.
After this disappointment , I never dare ruckin with certainty about the enjoyment of a pleasure again . It seems as if some fatality stood between you and me.
I am not good enough for you and you must be kept from the contamination of two intimate society.
A good neighbor of the Brontes is a clever , intelligent Yorkshure woman who keeps a drugis shop and high worth from her occupation . Her experience and excellent sense holds the position of village doctor and nurse and , as such , has been a friend many times of trial and sickness and death in the households round told me a characteristic little incident connected with tabby's ractured leg.
Tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was , as charlotte expressed it , one of the family.
He refused at first to listen to the careful advice . It was repugnant to his liberal nature.
This decision was communicated to the girls.
Tabby had tended them in their childhood and none other should tend her in her infirmity age.
After that time , they were sad and silent and the meal went away and touched by any of the three.
She had another method on her mind this Christmas
but Anne had begun to suffer dis before the holidays and Charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jealous igilance of some wild creature that would change her different nature if dangeros hreatens her young.
stum bynxiety for this little sister , she upbraded missed town for her fancy in difference to ansade of health.
Still , her heart had received a shock in the perception of ane's delicacy and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing for exiety which was so full of sedon pings of fear.
I doubt whether Bronwell was maintaining himself at this time.
To celebrate the arrival of her son , Sylvia gave a splendid supper to which he had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance.
Without saying it positively , she made me understand that , being herself and a religious member of the republic of letters , she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect.
In order to please her , I spoke to her about the abbey Conti and I had occasion to quote too many lines of that profound writer.
Madame corrected me with a patronising air about my pronunciation of the word scomvra , which means divided , saying that it ought to be pronounced scure and she added that I ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in Paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life.
Her face was an igma that spired every one with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively , there was not one beautiful feature . She could not be called handsome , but no one could have thought her ugly.
Sylvia was the adiration of France and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her , especially of the series of Marivo , for without her , his comedies would never have gone to prosterity.
Sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit , for she knew that she was virtuous only because her love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters , although she was satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue.
Two years before her death , I saw her berform the character of married Anne in the comedy of Meravox and , in spite of her age and declining health , the allusion was complete.
She was honourably buried in the church of Saint Sovere without the first opposition from the venerable priest , who , far from sharing the anti christian intolerance of the clergy in general , said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and that the earth was a common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind.
You will forgive me dear reader if I have made you tend the funeral of sylvia ten years before her death . Believe me , I have no intention of performing the miracle . You may consol yourself with the idea that I shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor sylvia dies.
I have never had any family.
I had a name I believed in my young days , but I have forgotten it since I was in service.
I shall call you a spree.
You do me a great honour.
Here go and get me change for a Louis . I have it sir.
at chor service sir.
Madame Quinson , answer your inquiries.
I saw a number of chairs for higher at the rate of one young man reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees , girls and men breakfasting either alone or in the company of waiters who were rapidly going up and down and narrow staircase hidden under the foliage.
I sit down at a small table , a waiter comes immediately to inquire about my wishes.
I want to give me some coffee if it is good.
Then turning towards me , he says that I look like a foreigner and when I say that I am an Italian , he begins to speak to me about the court city of the theatres and at last he offers to accompany me everywhere.
I think of him and take my leave.
I address him in a Talian and he answers very wittirly , but his words make me smile and I tell him why.
My remark pleased him , but I soon proved to him that it is not the right way to speak , however perfect it may have been the language of that ancient writer.
I saw a crowd in one corner of the garden , everybody standing in Stown looking up.
is there not a meridian everywhere.
Hess but the Maridian of the Pale Royale is the most exact.
That is true baddo gree.
All these honest people are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled.
It is sold everywhere , but for the last three weeks nobody has used any snuff but that is sold at the Sebet cat.
is it better than anywhere else.
but how did she manage to render it so fashionable.
simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her box filled and by saying to the young girl who handed back the box that her snuff was the very best and Paris.
You are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article . In the first case , it receives the welcom of intelligent and talented people and in the second , fools are always ready to reward it for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear sillinness is the daughter of whit.
Let a man run and everybody will run after him . The crowd will not stop and the man is proved to be mad , but to prove it is indeed a difficult task because we have a crowd of men who have been mad from their birth are still considered wise.
It seems to me I replied that such a proval such ratification of the opinion expressed by the king , the princes of the blood et cetera is rather approof of the affection felt for them by the nation , for the French carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them in fallible.
When the king comes to Paris , everybody calls out a lheroy.
She introduced me to all her guests and gave me some proticulars respecting every one of them.
What Sir I said to him am I fortunate enough to see you.
He himself recided the same passage in French and politely pointed out the parts in which he thought that I had improved on the original.
For the first day , Sir , I think that what you have done gives me great hope and , without any doubt , you will make rapid progress.
I believe it sir and that is what I fear . Therefore , the principal object of my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of my friend 's language.
I am a very unpleasant pupil , always asking questions , curious , troublesome , aggressive and even supposing that I ca meet with the teacher I require , I am afraid I am not rich enough to bay him.
I res ied in the matre grow de tooth port.
I will make you translate them into French and you need not be afraid of my finding you insatiable.
He had a good appetite , good story without laughing , celebrated for his whitty rebbotes and his sociable manners , but he spent his life at home , seldom going out and seeing hardly any one because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day.
His house had the management of everything . She never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept all together because he never asked her to render any accounts.
On the sixth of April eighteen thirty , the church of Jesus Prist of latterday saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence.
Its origin was small a germ and an insignificant seed , hardly thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
Instead of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two squore of adherence , the organization numbers a hundred thousand souls.
In place of a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have comgligated there now are about seventy stakes of zion and about seven hundred organized wards , each ward and stake with its full compliment of officers and presed organizations.
The practice of gathering its proselites into one place prevents the building up and strengthening afford branches and much as extencive and strong organizations are seldom with broad , very ironeous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church.
Nevertheless , the mustard seed among the smallest of all seats hasitated the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches , the acord is now in an oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pogrim journeying its way to truth.
Their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun , not merely that the work of prosletting should be carried on in the west , but that the headquarters of the church should be there astablished.
In the book , a mormon taught that people the true horrigon and destiny of the American Indians and toward this dark skined remnant of a once mighty people , the missionaries of Mormonism turned their eyes and with their eyes wint their hearts and their hopes.
It is notable that the Indian tribes have carely regarded their religion of the latter day saints with favour , seeing in the book a morning striking agreement with their own traditions.
The first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of Curtlind , Ohio , almost within sight of the lake , and here soon rose the first temple of modern times.
To the fervent laterday saint , a temple is not simply a church building and a house for religious assembly.
Soon , thousands of converts had rented or purchased homes and Missouri a dependence on Jackson County being their center , but from the first they were unpopular among the missourians.
The Lieutenant governor , Little Bentabu Bogs afterward , was a pronounced mormon hater and throughout the period of the troubles he manifested his sympathy with the persecutors.
Their sufferings have never yet been fitly cronicled by human scribe.
Making their way across the river , bhost of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of claycounty and , afterward , istablished themselves called Well County . They re indownting the city in the far west.
A small settlement had been made by mormon families on Shol creek and here on the thirtieth of October , eighteen thirty eight accompany of two hundred and forty fellupon the hapless settlers and butcherd a score.
It said to the honour of some of the officers in trusted with a terrible commission that when they learned its true significance , they resigned their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold blooded butchery.
Oh what a record to read , what a picture te see , how awful the fact. is
American school boys read with emotions of horror of the albirgenzes driven beaten and killed with a pepa leggate directing the butchery and the thog dwa hunted and howded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scens as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate.
who began the quarrel was the Mormons.
As the sable of the press comments against the brutality of the missourians I quote apparagraphs from the Quincy Arguss March sixteen eighteen thirty nine.
It will be observed that an organized mob , aided by many of the civil and military officers of Missouri with governor bogs at their head , has been the prominent actors in this business , inciting two it appears against them mormons bi political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge.
The army found that people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth.
But a word further concerning the expedition in general.
It was through floyd ad vice to becanted order the military expedition to Utah austensibly to install certain federal officials and two repress and alleged infantil rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the intrate of these escessionists.
Moreover , had people been inclined to rebellion while great opportunity could be wished.
Already the South were talking about who set up west.
They knew no north , no south , or east , no west . They soot positively by the constitution and would have nothing to do with the bloody stripe between brothers ' unlestened deed . They were sommoned by the authority which they had already once loyelly responded to furnishing men and arms for the countri's need.
What the letter says means less related to marriage than characteristic of the church and is in very general practice , but in solesto marriage , plurality of wives was an incident never an essential.
We believe it is a literal resurrection in an actual hereafter in which future states shall be recognized every sinctified an authorized relationship existing here on earth of parent and child , brother and sister , husband and wife.
It has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one , yet to find the place and meet the people where with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among the meligned moremons in the mountain valleys of the west.
At the inception of porol marriage among the modern saints , there was no law national or state against its practice.
In eighteen sixty two a law was introduced with the purpose of suppressing woreld marriage and , as had been predicted in the national senate priyor to its passage at lay for many years , had dead letter.
Federal judges and United States hattorneys and newtap who were not mormons nor lovers have marmonism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest in justice and inadequacy.
This bent that foran illeged mister meaningful for which congress prescribed a maximum pedalty of six months on prisoment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be in prison for life and for many terms of human natural life , the court's power to enforce its sentences extens so far and might be fined millions of dollars.
Therefore , this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and met with the reversal and rebukeat deserved prisoned under a sentence of many years duration.
The people contessed these measures one by one in the courts , presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure.
Then the church was disincorporated and its property would be real and personal , confisicated and was shiated to the government of the United States and , although the personal property was soon restored , real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the court receiver and the morman church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property.
and so the story of mormonism runs on its fanali has not yet been written . The current press presents continuously new stages of its progress and new developments of its plan.
mainhole like Dalexander because he was an engineer.
We had freqoncied ideas about everything and his idea of Americans was that they should be engineers and mechanics.
It's tremendously well put on too.
It's been only weeks and I've been happy at times already.
You know Alexander may hold look with preplexity into the top of the handsome and rugged pink cheek with his bloved finger ? Do you know I sometimes think of taking criticism seriously ?
She saved her hand too . She did her best in the second back.
He's been anted to be married for three years or more.
She doesn't take up with anybody you know.
Recently , Bere , one of her family members , told me with confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.
Mane held out for her constancy with the lottiness that made Alexander smile even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him.
He's another whose awfuly kind about her . Let me introduce you.
Sir Harry Town Mister Bartry ellexandered American Engineer.
I say Si Harry he little girl's going famously to night asn't she.
Wono I thought the dance was a bit conscious at night for the first time.
West and I were back after the first balloon . We thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself.
A little attack of nerves possibly.
He was beginning to feel a keen interest in the slender bearefoot dawnky girl who slipped in and out of the play singing like someone winding through a hilly field.
One night , when he and Winafred were sitting together on the bridge , he told her the things that had happened while he was studying abroad , but he was sorry for one thing in particular and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them.
She considered her moment and said No I think not the way . I'm glad you asked me.
After that , it was easy to forget , actually to forget.
Of course , he reflected , she always had that combination of something horridly sensible and something utterly wild and deaft.
She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to.
I'm glad she's held around sense.
After all , we were awfully knone.
You shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it now.
The hilder was very nice to him and he sat on the edge of his chair flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar.
They asked him to come to see them and check and they spoke very tenderly of helda.
Lambwold a great deal about many of them I fancy.
When Bartley arrived at Betford Square on Sunday evening , Barie , the pretty little French girl , methim the door and took him upstairs.
I should never have asked you if Smalli had been here , for I remember you don't like English cooking .
I haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is.
They are all sketches made about the villadesta you see.
The coworkers are all very loyal , even in the main hall.
I've managed to save something every year and that with helping my three sisters now and then and tiding poor cousin Michael bed seasons.
It's not particularly rare , she said , but some of it was my mother's.
There was water cres soup and soul and a delightful onlet stuffe with mushrooms and truffles and two small rare ducklings and art ochopes and a dry yellow roan wine of which Partley had always been very fownd.
There is nothing else that looked so dolly.
Thank you , but I don't like it as much as this.
Have you been sick in these later years.
There are few changes in the old quarter.
I 'm so sorry to hear how your son turned out.
Her hair is still like flac and er blue eyes or just like a baby and she has the same three freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to her banda maire.
how jolly it was being a young helda.
Do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris.
Come we'll have her coffee in any other room and you can smoke.
I think we did . she answered merily.
What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our franks but just our youth.
They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money , God give you a happy love.
The strange woman and her passionate sentences that rang out so sharply had frightened them both.
Bartley started when she held out a little bell beside her dear me . Why did you do that. ?
It was very jolly , he murmured lasily as Marie came in to take away the coffee.
Have I told you about my new play.
When she finished , Alexander shook himself out of a reveree.
Nonsense Of course , I ca sing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me.
It's really warm in the room to sing , don't you feel it.
Alexander went over and opened the window for her.
there just in front.
He stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it soft and misty see how cute the stars are.
For a long time , the side of us barely spoke.
He felt a tremmor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him.
barely leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear " you are giving me a chance yes.
Alexander clunched two hands at his sides.
The stop in the queen's town , the tedious passage of the mercy were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
She blushed and smiled and fonbled his card in her confusion before she ran up the stairs.
Alexander pased up and down the hallway buttening and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to Mount his living room.
The room was empty when he entered.
Alexander did not sit down.
I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something special was going to turn up.
I thought it might be sister Kater 's cousin , Mike , who would be going along.
She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool on the opposite side of the hearth , her knees drawn up to her chin , laughing like a happy little girl.
When did you come bart lying and how did it happen ? You have n't spoken a word.
I got in about ten minutes ago.
Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
barely bent down over the fire.
She looked at his heavy shoulders and bigged determined head brusted forward like a catapulein lash.
I'll do anything you wish me too bartley she said tremelously.
I can't stand seeing you miserable.
He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
hill to watch him from the corner trembling and scarcely breathing , dark shadows growing about her eyes
but it's worse now . it's unbearable.
I get nothing but misery out of either.
The world is all there just as it used to be but I can't get at it any more.
It was myself . I was defying helda.
Hel this face quivered but she whispered , I think it must have been.
But why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer.
Alexander groaned . I meant to but somehow I couldn't.
She pressed his hand gently and was grateful
made you happy then at all.
She closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in the fragrance of those days.
He moved on easily and his chair creeked.
Yes yes , she hurried , pulling her hand gently away from him.
Please tell me one thing Bartley , at least tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy.
Yes , I know that , he said simply.
I understand Bartley I was wrong.
But I didn't know you had to tell me now.
What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often I come , no matter how hard I begin
keep away a few wishes when av i ever follow you.
Aexander rose and shook himself angrily , Yes I know I'm chowardly.
He took a roughly in his arms do now what I mean.
What what am I to do. ?
I will ask the least imaginable , but I must have something.
I must know about you.
The sight of you barely seeing living and happy and successful can never make you understand what that means to me.
You see , loving someone one is I love you share the whole world .
and then you came back not caring very much , but it made no difference.
barely bent over and took her in his arms , kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes.
I don't cry don't cry , he whispered.
and tortured each other enough for to night.

His most ambitious desire was to enduce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much loved home and so incessitly were serveidax ears besieged with the scriptions of the unparallel beauty and advantages of this eighteenth ondesymo of Paris that he could scarcely hear the name of montmarchra without a conscious thrill of a version.

A mik his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power , but his inexhaussible memory made him a living in dictionaries and for his stock of anecdotes and troopers tals he was matchless.
vast as his legs could carry him , a dack had made his way to the top of the cliff.
It was quite true that a vessel was hardly more than six miles from the shore , but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision , the rigging of the top mass alone was visible above the water.
exclaimed the servadac keeping his eye unmoved by his telescope.
She is undersaile but she is counting timishef's yacht . He was right.
If the count were on board , a strange fatality was bringing him into the presence of his rival.
He reckoned therefore , not only upon anscertaining the extent of the late atastrophe but upon learning its cause.
The wind being adverse , the dobrena did not make very rapid progress , but as the weather , in spite of a few clouds , remained calm and the sea was quite smooth , she was enabled to hold the steady course.
The servadack took it for granted that the dogrina was endeavoring to put in.
A narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the warm weather would ensure the calmness of its waters.
slightly changing her course , she first struck her main sail and , in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman , soon carried nothing but her two top sails rigantine a jib.

nothing more than you know yourself.
Are you certain that this is the mediterranean.
For some moments , he seemed perfectly stupefied and then , recovering himself , he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions.
to all these inquiries , the count responded in the affirmative.
Some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements.
You will take me on board will you not. ?
My yard is at your service sir , even should you require to make a tour around the world.
The count shook his head.

A slight dimmunution the extreme high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things , but whether this was to be attributed to any alterration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide.
Doubts now arose and some discussion about whether or not it was desirable for Bensoof to accompany his master.
Her seagoing qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
After an opprenticeship on a merchant ship , he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant . A mecount appointed him to charge of his own private yacht on which he was accustomed to spending a greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters.
The late - interesting events , however , had rendered procope manifastly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety.

He it not impossible , he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely.
would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible.
Another circumstance was most remarkable.
To the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of five fathoms and although the sounding persevered continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area , the differences in level were insignificant , not corresponding in the emmy degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terrassed like the seats of an empatheatre.
You must see Lieutenant . I should think that we are not as near the coast of Algeria as you imagined.
After pondering a while , he said , if we were farther away , I should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred kilometers instead of five fabhoms five fathoms.
Its depth remained at variable four or at most five fathoms and although it's bottom was siduously dredged , it was only to prove it was bearon of marine production of any type.
Nothing was to be done but to put about and return and disappointment toward the north.

Thirty men , one after another , raised their horns and said.
As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water , I made a song and sang it.
So we harried the coast of Norway.
We ate many men's tables invited.
I draghins belly never fell and on board went the gold.
All it is better to live on the Sa and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals.

Even down the water we went to get wealth and a frollic.
Wot of the farm all love , yet I answered Viking is better for summer.
It was so dark that I could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth.
I stood with my back to the wall because I wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me.
Come come I called when no one obeyed the fire.
My men laughed at the heavily astingy host.
He acts as though he was not expecting us.
On a bench in the far corner , a dozen people huddled together.

The throws were ringing in a great pot of meat.
They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it and we sad and watched the boil while we joked and finally the supper began.

Their eyes danced , big Toreleaf stood up and stretched himself.
I'm stiff from long sitting . He said I ordered to fight . I turned to the farmer.
This is our last feast with you , I said.
With the beard of Owd no cryed you have taken our joke like a man.
My men pounded the table with their fists.

They drink heartseese from it for many years.
and with it I leave you a name through the friendly . I shall hope to drink with you some time in Halla.
Here is a ring for sift the friendly and here is a bracelet and a sord would not be ashamed to hang it by your side.

They drew their swords , hit their faces and the flaps of their cloaks turned back and soon came in front of the little party who had not yet done giving thanks to god for the escape from those hodacious men.
Finally , one party went off exalting and the other was left in desolation and will.
redollfol arrived at his own house without any impediment . Hawleocadious parents reached their hearts broken and despairing.
Meanwhile , Rudolefo had Locati safe in his custody and in his own apartment.
Ctuchos me amd I embed.
Mother do your father do you hear me.
It is the only ammen'se ie ask of you for the wrong you have done to me.
She found the door but it was locked outside.
She succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight showne in so brightly that she could distinguish the color of some damask hanging in the room.
She saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed like that of a prince rather than that of a private gentleman.
Among the other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucific of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window.
This person was awful . Though he had gone to look for his friends , he had changed his mind in that respect , not thinking it advisable to acquaint them but what had passed between him and the girl.
On the contrast , he resolved to tell them that , repenting of his violence and moved by a tear , he had only carried her halfway towards his house and then let her go.
choking with e motionlocadia made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them.
That would be very well , my child replied to her father if your plan would not lie to be frustrated by ordinary cunning . I no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner and he would have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there.
What you had best do my child is to keep it and pray to it that his sins were a witness to your undoing . It would daign to vindicate your couse by its righteous judgment.
Thus did the humane and right - minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother , embraced her again , did all she could to sooth her feelings.
She meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest to retirement , never letting herself be seen but shunning every eyelisted should read her misfortune in her face.
As time rolled on , the hour her delivery arrived . It took place in the best secrecy and the mother took upon her the office of midwife as she gave birth to a son , one of the most beautiful ever seen.
When the boy walked through the streets , blessings where showered upon him by all who saw him . Blessings upon his beauty , on the mother who bore him and the father that begat him , upon those who brought him so well.
One day , when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation , he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horseman.
The bed she too well remembered was there and , above all , the cabinets on which had stood the image ye had taken away was still in the same spot.
The law was out of danger in a fortnight and a month . He rose from his bed and drew all that time . He was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child.
Thus saying ampressing the crucifix to her breast , she fell fainting into the arms of Danna Issafania , who was a gentle woman to whose six pityes a natural cruelty as to man instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl shetting over her so many tears that their needed no other sprinkling of water to recover the ocadia from her soon.
I have quit things to tell you . Sinor said dornlas ta fangye to her husband lo criam and the substance of which is that the fainting girl before you is your daughter and the boy is your grandson.
This truth which I have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we have both beheld that of our son.
Just then , Locatea came to herself and embracing the cross seemed to change into a sea of tears and the gentleman remained in artebe wilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end the whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimones.
So persuasive were her intreaties and so strong resurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she thought they were induced to confess that one summer's night she had mentioned her and another friend being out on a stroll with redolful they had been concerned in the adoption of a girl whom he dolfol carried off whilst the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could.
For god's sake , my lady mother gave me a wife who would be a greeable companion , not one who will discuss me so that we may both bur evenly and with mutual good will to yogimpost ar mas by heaven an sad of pulling this way and that way and fretting each other to death.
Her bearing was graceful and animated . She led her son by the hand and before her walked to maides with wax slights and silver cantle sticks.
al rose to do her reverence as if something from heaven had meraculously appeared before them , but gazing on her and trance with admiration , not one of them was able to address a single word to her.
She reflected on how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever and , racked by the intensity of her emotions , he suddenly changed color . Her head dropped and she fell forward in to swoon into the arms of the dismaye ast to fania.
His mother had left her to him as her destine protector and when she saw that he too was insensible , she was teare making a third and would have done so had he not come to him
No then , son of my heart , that this fainting lady is your weal brigde I say real because she is the one whom your father and I have chosen for you and the portrait was supretence.
just at the moment when the tears of the piting beholders flowed fastest and their ere jaculations where the most expressive of despair , locatia gov signs of recovery and broagd back gladness in the hearts of all.
When she came to her senses and blushing to find herself and wod Olf as arms would have disengaged herself nor Sidneura , he said that she must not strive not to withdraw from the arms of him who holds you in his soul.
This was done because the event took place at a time with the consent of the parties , which was sufficient for the celebration of marriage without any of the prliminary formalities which are now so properly required.
nor ass rere dowful less surprised than they and ta bedter to assure himself or so wonderful a fact he begged the localia to give him some token which should make perfectly clear to him that which indeed he did not doubt since it was authenticated by his parents.
You know Captain Lake.
said Lord Shelford , addressing me.
He had his hand upon the lake 's shoulder.
Their cousins , you know we are all cousins.
Whatever Lord Chelford said , Miss Brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile.
but her greeting to Captain Leake was more than usual , haughty and frozen and her features I fancied particularly proud and pale.
At dinner , leake was easy to amusing.
I'm glad you would like it , says Wirelder , chuckling bheningnantly at it over his shoulder.
I believe I have a little taste that way they are all real . You know those jewels.
and he pleased it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little paralela gram with a gleam of sly amusement.
I was thinking it's very like the aparts answered , the captain softly smiling on.
whereupon Lake laughed quietly , still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
and wiled her lefed two more suddenly and noisily . The huor of the joke seemed quite te call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes , but the gallat captain did not seem to proceive it and after a few seconds , he handed it very innocently thack to missus darthy only remarking.
As you know , Lape Oh I really can't tell , but he'll soon tire of country life.
He's not a man for country quarters.
I had a horrid dream about him last night .
Oh , I know that's born Brandon.
All the time he was talking to me , angry little eyes were following Lyake.
Miss Lake declined the carriage night.
and he added something still less complimentary.
but these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly.
In the meantime , I had formed a new idea for her.
By this time Bor Chelfard Amalder returned and , disgusted with myself , I ruminated on my desire for generalship.
and he made a little dip of his cane towards branded hall over his shoulder.
He asked , so they said , but that would , I think , have been worse.
It ol fellow's been a little bit wild . He beonds a bovet once.
He is a very good fellow , I can assure you.
I don't know when can't say how you find gentlemen to find wickedness only as an obscure female . I speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county.
While you know dark women like wicked fellows , it is a contrast , I suppose , but they do and I'm sure from what Bract has said to me , I know him intimately that Dorcis likes him and I can't cenceive why they are not married.
There Wal continued silent for the greater part . Neither was quite satisfied with the other , but Rachel at last said.
Now that's impossible , because I really don't think I once thought of him all the sevening except just Wally wearing talking.
There was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging bowhs and witheredleaves and the modl bites and shadows glided oddly across his palefeatures.
Don't insult me Stanley by talking again as you did this morning.
when I say it is altogether on your own account.
Mark my words , you find him too strong for you . and two deep.
I 'm very uneasy about it , however it is , I can't help it.
To my mind , there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family fus.
The mystery of their origin , their capacity for evolving leden faculties of crime and the strict bytality with which they survive the herse and speak their deep mouth middlinitees in every newborne generation have associatd them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and e special say tack action.
The floor , more than anything else , showed the great age of the room.
My bed was unexceptional and comfortable , but in my vhen mood I could have wished it a great deal more modern.
The curntins were thick and feet ed tapistry.
All the frniture belonged to other times.
I shan't trouble you with my train of thoughts or fancies , but I began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story watching experimentally in a haunted chaberer.
I did not even take the pecaution of smoking up the chimney.
I bullblelighted my route.
A cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows.
In the summer , old trees like Jigantic nose bloom black and awful.
Somehow , I grew nervous.
A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly.
It was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of Redmont's farm.
While she was better , though she had had a bad night.
So there came a step and a little rustling of feminin dreeperies the small door opened and Rachel entered with her hand extended and a pail smile of golcam.
Women can hide their pain better than we men and bar it better too , except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice.
but poor Rachel Lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which ennables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile.
This transit spring and lighting up are beautiful a glambour beguidling our senses.
There was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was nutery chol and comforting and she returned the greating as kindly and felt more like her former self.
Rachel's pale and sharpend features and dilydid ye struck her with a painful surprise.
He was so angry at my poor rechel.
ill and trouble , dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous.
Poor Rechel heard nature recoiled from deceit and she told events as much of the truth as she dared.
She spoke with a sudden energy which partook with fear and passion and flushed her cheek and made her languid eyes flash.
Thank you Rachel . My cousin Rachel is my only friend.
Chelford had a note from Mister Walder this morning , another note that his arrival was delayed and something of his having to see some person who was abroad continued dorkess after a little pause.
Yes something everything , said , Rachel listening looking frowndingly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers.
Yes , said Rachel.
and the waning audience having spoken , she sat down in the same sort of obstraction again beside Dorkus and she looked full in her cousin's eyes.
Mark , I say that his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply that you will never ask me to speak again about him.
It is an antipathy and intipathy I can not get over dear dorguess you may think it is madness , but don't blame me.
I have very few to love me now and I thought you might love me as I have begun to love you.
and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and breeveery chol at last burst into tears.
dorguess in her strange way , was moved.
I like you still Rachel . I'm sure I'll always like you.
You resemble me Rachel . You are fearless and inflexible and generous.
Yes Rachel , I do love you.
Thank you sincerely
He began to complain about the wizard who appeared behind the curtain on the left.

He was like a father in a way and yet he was not my father.
Also , there was a stripling page who turned it into a maid.
This was so sincerely desir and in some ways I do think she died.
but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came.
Sister Nol , do you hear these marvels.

and then they became vexed and would aves nashed our purse for us.
I could not see my boy injured excellence but doing his duty as one of cumberland' sons.
So I did push this fellow.
It eenough said George game well sharply as he turned upon the crowd.
She made ouse to cry , I blushed for my coworkers and not incam.
First , we can submit with good grace.

But I restled with this fellow and do know that he played on fairly in the second bout.

The strollers took their part with hardyzasse now that they had some chance of beating off their foes.
robit in the little tumplwer between them tried to force the squire to stand back and very valeanly to let these two comfort themselves.
The headand chief of the riot , then Nodtingham he printice with clenched fists , threatened Monty Sha.
The squire helped te thrust the all in and entered swiftly himself.
Night be silent alone he began , but the captured a prentice set up an instant chout.
Silence unive cried monfiche.
He felt for the whiserd's black cloth . The squire was quite out of breath.
thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent , the robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout.

Taking advantage of these thesquires you men doubled their efforts and were encouraged by robins and the little strollers crying after waiting for him.
George Montfe Sha will never forget this day.

Right willingly , for between us we have won the battle answered robin.
I'd like you to . You are the second will that I have met with in two days . Is there a sign of that.

Pray follow us with mind my lord Char iffs men.

Master monseu the sheriff of Nodding Hamb , was mightily put about when told of the rioting.
and Henry might return to England at any moment.
Have your child if the boy also wills it must be answered , feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then.
He made an effort to hide his condition from them all and the robin felt his fingers tightend upon his arm.
begged me for a room at the sheriff 's immediately
but who tis fellow plucky it was speeve.
He is my esquire excellency returned robin with ticnity.
Mistress Fitzoth had been carried off by the sheriffes daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house , so that Brouh alone had the care of Molti her
Robin was glad when at night they were left to their own devices.
The wind certainly brings back the colourd to the squire's 's cheeks.
These escapates are not for old games well led his day has come to twilight.
Will you forgive me now.
It will be disappointing me.
No thanks , I am glad to give you such easy happiness.
You are a worthy leat will presently whisper that the wine is a marvel.
I 'll show you some pretty tricks.
young fits ooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so asoon as he had come out from his converse with the squire.
Therel fell into an anxious interview with her mistress , arguing for and against their squire's project in the breath.
He must all think of his father what he would counsel.
If for a long time you begger yourself , I cannot stay with you.
But take it will live and monfy their shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so bright a sight , for you will narror disgrace our stuch and I warrant me.
The lad ajectd him then.
Never that sir , he had said.
He was in deep discussion with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm.
Now to bed boy.
Tis late and I go by myself in a short time .
dismiss your squire robin and bidme good yen.
As any person in Angland Ie would say , said Kenewell proudly , that was in his day.
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning come.
There was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to gam well's room .
Recently , he crossed the floor of his room with a decided step.

We will go out together to the bower . There is a way down to the cort from my window.
rest and be still until a warn you.
The hours passed wearily by and movement could be heard in the hall.
At Finally , all was quiet and black in the courtyard of Gamewell.
will whisper robin opening his door as he spoke , are you ready. ?
They then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs.
A robin entered the hot dragging the unwilling esquire after him.
be not so foolish , friend said fittuoth crossly.
They moved there after cautiously about the hut , groping before and about them to find something to show that the warrant in an idfulfilled mission.
There were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuttly ha tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit.
First hand rested at last upon the top rumn of a ladter and slowly the truth came to him.
The robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm brocky ground.
student was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to as certain the shape and character of this mistake .
From the blackness behind the light , they heard a voice warrantons.
save me master's but you startle me rarely.
cried , waving the lanthern before him to make sure that there were no ghosts in front of him.
inquired robin with his suspicion still upon him.
Truly , such a horse would be worth it and notting him fair.

Warrant spoke thus with significance to show rob in that he did not think Jeffrey's claim to the estate would be passed by.
Robind Fitsoth saw that his doubts of warrn had been fair and he became ashamed of himself for harporing them.
His tones rang pleasantly onwarrantans ears and fourth , , the good fellowship was haralded between them.
The old servant told him quietly as they crept back to Gaimwill at this passageway led from the hut in the pleasants to Shurwood and that Jeffrey , for the time , was hiding with the outlaws in the forest.
He implores us to be disgreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life as in the hollow of our hands.
They regain their apartment , apparently without disturbing the household of gainwell.
Out in the woods stood a nice little fur tree.
The piece he had was a very good one . The sun showed on him as fresh air . There was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs.
He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air . He did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries.
but this was what the tree could not bear to hear.
In winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground , a hair would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree.
Oh that made him so angry.
to grow and grow to get older and be tall , thought the tree , after all , is the most bright thing in the world.
In autumn the wood cutters always come and felled some of the largest trees.
This happened every year and the young furtry that had now grown to a very comply size trembled at the sight of the magnificent great trees falling to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and before they were hardly to be recognized and then they were ladin carts and the horses dragged othem out of the wood.
Have you not met many ?
rejoice in the growth , said the sunbeams.
and then what happens then.
I would fay no if I was destined for such a glorious a career , cried the tree rejoicing.
I am now tall and my branches have spread like the others that were carried off last year oh.
were but old ready on the cart.
I was in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence.
Yes and something better , something still Grandler will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ortament me.
Something better , something still grander , must follow , but what.
brechoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight.
rejoice in my own fresh youth.
but the tree did not rejoice at all . He grew and grew and was green both winter and summer.
and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down.
The axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh . He felt a pang like a swoon . He could not think of happiness , for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up.
He well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more , perhaps not even the birds.
but departure was not at all agreeable.
The trie olly came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid , we don't want the others.
There too were large easy chairs , silken sophas large tables full of picture books and full of toys with hundreds and hundreds of crowns and the children had so.
The servants as well as the young ladies decorated it.
This evening they all said.
how it will shine this evening
Perhaps the other trees from the forest came to teach me.
It blazed up famously help help.
Cri the young ladies a d they quickly put out the fire.
a story.
a story where the children draw a little fat man towards the tree.
But I shall tell only one story.
He was not be downstairs and yet he married the princess.
That's the way of the world.
thought the first try and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well.
I won't tremble tomorrow thought of the fur tree.
and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought.
In the morning , the servants and the housemaide came in.
But they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here there was a dark corner where no daylight could enter . They left him.
What's the meaning of this tree. ?
and he leaned against the wall , lost in revery.
time enough for his reflections for days and night's passed and nobody came up and when last everybody came , it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way.
It is now winter outside doors bought the tree.
How kind a man is , after all.
if it were not so dark here and so terribly lonely.
sweak squick.
They snuffed about the vertree and rustled among the branches.
I am by no means old , said the tree.
There's many people considerably older than I am.
They were so extremely curious.
I know no such place , said the tree.
and then he told them all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said.
said the fur tree was thinking over what he had himself related.
Yes , those were happy times.
Po , who is Hopy Dumpy , asked the mice.
only one answered the tree.
It is a very stupid story.
Do you know one about Bican and Talo candles ? Can't you tell any lader stories.
No , said the tree.
Then they said goodbye to the rats and they went to their hometown .
Finally , the little mice stayed away and the tree sighed . After all , it was very pleasant when the sleek little mie sat round me and listened to what I told them.
Now that two is over.
Why One morning there were a number of people set to work in the loft.
The trunks were moved , the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard . It falling down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone.
but it was not the tired tree that they meant.
It was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles.
The golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine.
In the court yard , some of the marriad children were playing who had danced a Christmas round the tur tree and were so glad at the sight of him.
and the gardener chopped the tree into small pieces . There was a whole heap lying there.
The wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and its side so teeply.
However , it was over , now the tree was gone , the story had an end.
to ten Beth Refram from Delling , the other girls or Uncle John of Old Rogers , visited , but they got Mister Watton in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for fourth ocheck.
It was a serious crime indeed . Mister Watson told them and Tom gates baged the fair to serve a lengthy term in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash act.
I gan't see it in that light , said the old law
It was a deliberate teft from his employer's to protect a girl he loved.
but they could not have proven a case against Lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of resting her were probably a mere bluff.
He was so harded in impetuous said , and being in love , he didn't have to count the cost.
If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forge check , then the young man would be allowed freedom.
But under the circumstances , I think such an arangement could be made.
Fairview was twelve miles away , but by ten o'clock they drew up on the county train .
They were eceived in the little office by a man named Markhum , who was the jailer.
We wished to talk with him , answered Kenneth .
I'm reading for the representative on the republican ticket , said Kennoth quietly.
I'l say that's different observed markum altering is dimmeter.

They followed the jailer along a succession of passages.
Sometimes , um , that yearn to infer a smoke is nearly crazy and do know which is worse doing one way or the other .
He arnocked the door and called visitors tom.

Mister Graff said Kenneth noticed the boy's face critically as he stood where the white from the passage fell upon it.

Se town please say gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a penchere.
A fresh , wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes , an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth.
We have heard something of your story , said Kenneth , and we are interested in it.
I didn't stop thinking whether it was foolish or not . I did it and I'm glad I did it.
hold well as a fine fellow , poor and helpless since Missus Rogers had her accident.
Then roders would do anything but leader around and wait upon her and the place went to rocken ruin.
He spoke simply but pasted up and down the narrow path in front of them.
Whose name would she sign the check asked Kenneth.
He is supposed to sign all the checks for the concert.
It's a stock company for the rich.
I was a bit keeper , so it was easy to get a blink check and forge the signature.
As regards my robbing the company , I'll say that I saved him a heavy loss one day.
I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole rental , but Marshall never even thought about me.
It was better for him to think the girl 's unfeeling tent to know the truth.
I'm going to see Mister Marshall said Kendeth and discover what I can do for you . Thank you sir.
I won't be much , but I 'm grateful to have found a friend.
They left him then for the jailor arive to lock the door and scort them to the office.
I've seen lots of that kind of my day.
and the runes and ceremonies
He looked up rather ungraciousleep but motioned them to be seated.
Some girls have been here twice to interview my men and I have refused to accept
I'm not electioneering just now.
Oh well sir , what about him. ?
and he desserves a term in state prison.
It costs me twice sixty dollars in annoyance.
I'll pay all the conpesides.
Your foolish . Why should you do all this.
I have my own reasons , Mister Marshall.
Give me a check for a hundred and fifty and i'l turnd over to you the forge check and qash further proceedings.
ha dedtested the grasping despisiouson that would endeavour to take advantage of his evident desire to help the gates.
bet's uneasy at the silence nudged him.
There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrood face.
He might have had that forged ceck for the face of it if he'd been sharp.
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars.
So , to the surprise of the democratic committee and his friends , Mister Hopkins announced that he would oppose an aggressive campaign with equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars on doing so as might be necessary.
One of Fister Hopkins ' first pasks after calling his faithful hinchmen around him was to make a careful canvase of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished.
The weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from opposition.
The democratic committee figured out a way to do this.
Under ordinary conditions , renolds was sure to be elected , but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to ele copkins.
The only thing needed was to fix the renalds and this was arranged personally.
and this was when Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
The description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both waughing hartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus Mister Hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were.
These women were fluttered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing the first forbes.
The employee hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were listed.
The fair view pant was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guess.
tables were spread on the lawn and a dainteep et substantial restaurant was to be served.
This was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elherst and the only win within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests.
The attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted to see great success in their fight.
We ought to have more attention because said Louise was approaching her cousin.
Won't you run into the house and see if Martha can't spare one or two more maids.
She was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when Aunt Jane was their mistress here and beth was her special favourite.
The housekeeper led the way and beth followed.
For a moment , , staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face.
She was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at Elm hurst , a playing black gown with a white baprint and cap.
Then she gave a little out and required no miss because it was Melizabeth person .
but it can't be protested by the girl.
I attend to the household mending you know and care for the women .
I speak like an educated person said wonderingly , where is your home. is
For the first time , the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
She sat down on a rock chair and clasped her hands in her lap , rocking slowly back and forth , I'm sorry , said beth.
Alye , a person shook her head.
Fate They excite me in some way and I ca bear them . You must excuse me.
She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.
Beth was a beautiful girl , the handsom of the three cousins by far , yet Alizea surpast her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact.
Her manter was neither independent nor assertive , but rather one of well pred composure and calm reliance.
Her eyes wandered to the maid's hands.
However , her features and might repress any evidence of nervousness , these hands told a different story.
She rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catcher breath.
I wish I knew myself . She cried fiercely.
Will you leave me alone in my own room or must I go away to escape you.
Aliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and the key clicked in the lock.

The English foated to the French baskets of flowers of which they had made a plantable trovision to greep the arrival of the young princess . The French , in return , invited the English to a sepper which was to be given the next day.
cangradulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey.
From the respect pain her on all sides , she seemed like a clean person and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three , she appeared an object of worship . The clean mother gave the French the most affectionate reception . The French were her native country and she has suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget friends.
She taught her daughter then by her own affection for it , that love for a country where they had both been hispitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them.
The count had thrown himself back on his sea , leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus , his face buried in his hands with a heaving chest and restless limbs.
This had indeed been a harassing day continued . The young man , his eyes fixed upon his friend.
You will be frank with me . I always am.
Can you imagine Wy Buckingham has been so finelent I suspect.
It is You Hermis taken Rau . I have read the distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action that day.
I can perceive love clearly enough.
I am convinced of what I said said in the account .
It is an annoyance then.
In those very terms , I even have more.
But we should not be interupted by this moment of his friend . Heaven be praise the French who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet , reckless , even capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bearow matters of such high importants.
Thus it is that the honor of three issaved are country master's and our own.
Yes , I need repose . Many things have agitated me today , both in mind and body . When you return to tomorrow , I shall no longer be the same man.
But in this friendly pressure , rowked detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict.
The night was clear starlett and splendid , the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored peace and security everywhere.

There was certainly not close a solution to their problem.
The poor little things cried synthia thinking of them having been turned to the wall these years.
Now what is the sending of two innocent babies like that.
but she was not listening all at once . She put down her candle on the table and faced her companion.
The twin brother did something she liked and she turned his picture on the wall.
Hers happened to be in the same frame too , but she evidently cared about it.
Now whar have you to say sinpias brog.
I thought we were stumped again when I first saw that picture but it was of some uwse after all.
Do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing.
What in the world is a clear choice.

It came in here this afternoon with old clothes on and half regular house clothes .
You can't hurt anything . I'm sure we won't disturb things at all.
This thought , however , did not enter the heads of the inthusiastic pair.
Smuggling the house claiming parfenelia into the cellar window on that afternoon proved no easy task for synthia had added a wisk brol and dust pan to the outfit.

Oh let him come along . She urged I love to see him about that old house.

fell and dusted the furniture and pictures.
Yet , little as it was , it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room.
surface had at least been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish.
When she suddenly remarked.
and my pocket money is getting low again and there is no left as usual.
They say alumination by candle is the prettiest in the world.
Here o go my hy seeusual they both cried peering in.

forgetting all their weariness , they seize their candles and sturry through the house finding an occasional piece of paper tucked away in an odd corner.
Well , was confisced at the bord et up house mystery happened no earlier than April sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later.
No words were spoken , no language was uttered saved from waling in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and nodd in reality.
I heard a noise and I turned and saw caffer his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife . He lifted it above his head as if to strike , but a had the strength of ten men and I hurled him from me.
onward said a distant voice.
No sound broke the stillness of the knight.
The story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition I wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said.
What was that.
What then , a human hand large and shapely appears distinctly on the surface of the pond.
nothing more , not even the rist to which it might be attached.
It did not beckin or indeed move at all . It was as still as the hand of death.
I woke to consciousness . . At first it seemed as if I was fighting with the fantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me . It was catfere.
the sound of voices and the flash of light.
a feeling of freedom and I was awake
said another voice which I recognized was Tars Casher.
I had scarcely known what I had been saying or doing up to this time , but as he spoke I looked at my hand.
In the light of the moon I saw a knife covered with blood and my hand too was also discolored.
I do not know . I am dazed and bewildered.
but that is a caffer's knife.
I knew he was in the very evening.
I remember saying have we been begether.
The chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it.
I say you do know what this means and you must tell us.
A terrible thought flashed into my mind.
I had again been acting under the influence of this man's power.
Perchance too caffer's death might serve him in good stead.
My tongue refused to articulate my power of speech and laughed at me.
My position was so terrible.
my over brought nerves yielded at last.
For some time after that , I remembered nothing .
the three modes of management.
To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
my reason and affection.
As the chase drives away , Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep , her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor 's destrust and suspicion of her mother , disappointment , vexation and ill humour sirge and swell among those delegate organizations of which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury.
The mother , as soon as the chase is so far turned that she can no longer watch the expression of her continance ghoes away from the door with a smile of complasency and satisfied with her face at the engenuity and uccess of her little partifice.
So you will be a good girl I know and not cause any trouble , but you will stay at home contentedly won't you.
The mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection.
If you are not a good girl , what should be signs of making us any trouble ? I will have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone.
But this last upposition is almost always unnecessary , for if Mary has been avitually managed on this principle , she will not make any trouble.
It is indeed true that the importance of tac and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated.
To such people , these different modes of training children inhabit of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence , are especially useful.
Della had a younger sister named Maria and a cousin whose name was Jane.
Now Gellia cantrive to obtain a great influence and a cendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
to givan idea of these conversations , I will report one of them in full.
You have come and della and dela were the names of Jeane's dolls to make rosely visit.
I am very glad.
I expect you have been a very good girl and Ella since you were here .
Then turning to Jane , she asked in a somewhat altered tone if she was a good girl , Jane.
For instance , one day the children had been playing in the piazza with blocks and other play things and finally went into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done.
They were now playing with their dolls in the parlour.
Deli came to the parlour and , with an air of great mystery , teckened the children aside and set them in a wisper leave and della and rosely here and don't say a word to them.
So saying , she led the way on a tipto , followed by the children out of the room and round by a sircutous root to the piazza there.
said she was pointing to the blay things she see.
Put these plea things all away quickly and carefully and we will not let them know anything about your leaving them out.
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in maying them dispose to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been.
nature of the effect produced by early impressions.
That is almost nothing.
Theyre chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing.
Without going to any such extremist this , we can easily see unreflection how vast an influence on ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresse upon the mind.
The pain produced by an apt of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away , but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
but ander's cared nothing about that.
He made about so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumb . I can tell you when he saw it was nobody but Anders.
He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jacknife.
Now this knife was a splendid one , though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and it is new that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jacknife.
Yes , why not , thought Anders.
Seeing that I am so fine , I may as well go and visit the king.
I am going to the court ball answered anders.
and she took her hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and past the matnificent halls where courtiers in silk and vilvet stood bowing wherever he went.
four like is not . They must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
At the farther end of the largest hall , a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rose.
on huge silverplatters wore pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering cantors.
The princess sat down under a blue canopy with boquazse roses and she let ander sit in a golden chair by her side.
But you must eat with your cap on your head , she said , and was going to take it off.
The princess was certainly beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her , but with the cap which his mother had made , he would not give up in any condition.
He only shook his head.
Well , but now , said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chaine around his neck and set him down and kissed him.
That is a very fine cap you have , he said.
So it is Sen Anders.
and it is made out of mother 's best yarn and she mittet at herself and everybody trying to get it away from me.
With one jump , Anders got out of his chair.
He darted like en arrow through all the halls , down all the stairs and across the yard.
He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown , he said that Anders was stupid.
The younger face grew red.
but his mother hugged him close.
No , my little son , she said.
If you were dressed in silk and gold from top to toe , you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap.
At the conclusion of the banquet , which was served at 12 o'clock , the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated custume representing spring , which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornoment workers of the court.
Ah very well.
Lat am come in , then said the king and if Colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself aloront with the conversation , he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two customers
juttleman to your posts were upon Saint Anyan and feleroigh took their leave.
certainly sir , but I must have money to do that today .
What do you mean , inquired Louise.
He has given them too much grac nut to have others still to give them if they are required , which is the case at the present moment.
It is necessary , therefore , that he should comply . The king frowned.
does your imajesty then no longer believe that disloyal attempt.
Not at all . You are , on the contrary , most degreeable to me.
Your majesty is planning this affair .
You will take them from my private treasure.
The news circulated with the repidity of lightning during its progress . It cendled every variety of country 's desire and weird ambition.
The king had finished his toilet by nine o'clock . He appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers.
The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent daas or platform arected upon the borders of the lake . , a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction.
Suddenly , for the purpose of restoring peace in order , spraing accompanied by his whole court , made his appearance.
The seasons halles of spring followed him closely to form a quadreal which , after many words of more or less flattering import , was the commencement of the nands.
His legs , the best shaped at court , were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silk and hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself.
There was something in his carriage which resembled the boyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to sore along.
Yes , it is suppressed.
Far from its sire , your majesty has given no direction about it . They musicians have retained im.
Yes sire and ready - dressed for the ballet.
Sire , he said , your majesties most devoted servant approaches performing a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle.
The king seemed pleased with everyone present.
Monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.
the balley began , the effect was more than beautiful.
When the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers , when the simple untutered pandemime of the period only the more natural on account of the different different acting of the August actors had reached its commonating point of triumph , the theatre shook with tummultuous plause.
disdainful of a success of which Madame showed no acknowledgement , he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess.
By degrees , all his happiness , all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power , his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied.
But the king , who had from that moment became in reality the principal dancer in the quadreal cast a luok upon his vanquished rival.
Everyone one could observe his agitation and prostration , which was indeed the more remarkable , since people were not accustomed to seeing him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side , his head bewildered and as eyes with their bright intelligence demed.
Upon this , Madame Daine t turns her eyes languishingly towards the comt observing.
Do you think so ? she replied with indifference.
Yes , the character which your royal highness assumed is imperfect harmony with your own.
explain yourself.
I allude to the goddess.
The princess inquired no.
She then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
A quarter of an hour afterwards , he returned to the theatre , but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back , or , perhaps , for level is thus strangely constituted , he found that impossible even to remain much longer supparated from their presence of one who had broken his heart.
When she perceived the young man , she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself.
I recommend you the evening was most lovely.
indeed a.
I remember now and I congratulate myself do you love anyone.
Forgive me , I hardly know what I am saying a thousand times . Forgive me . Madam was right , quite right . This brutal exile has completely turned my brain.
There cannot be a doubt he received kindly for , in fact , you returned without his permission.
Madmaselle , why have I notded de vote sister or a true friend such as yourself.
Well , already here , they said to her.
I have been here for quarter of an hour , replied Labadier.
Did not the dancing amuse you no.
No more than the dancing.
Le vallier is quite a poetus said Tonysharant.
I am a woman and there are few people like me . Whoever loves me , flatters me . Whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well , say Montale , you do not finish.
It is too difficult , replied Mudmoiselle Detani Shalan , laughing loudly.
Lucky under do you not see the moon slowly rising sivering the most branches of the chestnuts and the oaks.

Well said Madmoiselle Detenechalant . I also think it is a good deal , but I will take care.

Quick quick then among the high reading aggressive said montalet stoop at the na you are so tall.
The young girls had indeed made themselves small , indeed visible.
She was here just now saying the count.
You are positive then.
Yes , perhaps I frightened her and what way.
How is it that Levalier said to Madmoiselle detenishant that the vicompd o bregalone spoke of you as louise.
It seems the king will not consent to it.
God gracious has the king any strength to interfere in matters of that kind.
I give my consent.
Oh I am speaking seriously , replied Montale , and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the Kings , I suppose is not louise.
but we ran , then said all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses , they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covert of the park.
In fact , the sound of Madames and the queen's carriages could be heard and the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers.
And this way , the fed of the whole court was fet also for the mysterious anhabitants of the forest , for certainly the deer and the pheasant on the branches , the fox in its hole were all listening.
All about him was a tumult of bright and broken colour scattered by broad plashes.
The mergancer had a crested head , ears desent drean black , a broad collar of lostrous white , black back , black and white wings , white belly , sides finely penciled and black and white and a breast rich chestnot red streeked with black.
His feet were red , his long narrow beak with its sal tooth edges and sharp hoped tip was bright red.
But here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls , halks and eagles . He had no rending calls.
But suddenly , strange and swift does a suicide in cormerant He shot down into the torent and disappeared beneath the surface.
Once fairly awing however , he wheeled and made back hurdly for his perch.
and it might have seemed that a trout of that size was a fairly substantial meal.
but such was his keenness that even while the wide fluks of his engored dovictim were still sticking out of the corners of his beak , his fierce red eyes were once more ppearing downward into the torent and sarch of fresh prey.
In thespair he hurled himself downward too soon.
The great hock foued huridly to etrieve his prey from the ground.
The cat growled softly , vicked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
In fact , he had just minished it . The last of the trout's tale had just tenished with a spasm down his straind gallet when the baffled hock caugt sight of him and swooped.
the howk a lighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless , as if surprised.
like his unfortunate little cousin , the teal he had felt the fear of death mitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the howk should not discern him.
The howk sat upon the branch and watched his quarrys swimming beyond the surface.
Almost instantly , he was forced to the top.
straightway in the hock lidted from his purch and darted after him.
but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down.
But at this frequent time , the heights of air , for all his savage valor , was troubled by the leaping waves in the tossing foam of these mad rapids . He did not understand them.
As he flew down , reaching utching talent , were not happy yards near the fugitives ' head.
where the wavs for an instant sank , they came closer but not quite within grasping reach.
but as before , the leaping waves of the brapids were too much for his pursuer and he was n't able to flap his way onward in the cloud of foam old doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike.
The hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a wesel not to be shaken off or vaded or deceived.
He had a lot of lin out and the place was none too free for a long cast , but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was sleeping
The last dropp fly , luck have it caught just in the corner of the hocks , angrily open beak hooking itself firmly.
At the sudden sharp sting of it , the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank.
The drug upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling.
Then the leader parted from the line.

The public legislature numbered thirty - six members.
This was at the march election eighteen fifty five.
That summer immigration , however , being mainly from the free states , greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties.
For general service , therefore requiring no special effort , the nu merical strength of the factions was about equal . On extra ordinary occasions , the two thousand border off in reserve lying a little farther back from the state line said that any time easily turned the scale.
The free state man had only their convictions , their intelligence , their courage and the moral support of the north . The conspiracy had a secret combination of the territoryal fficials the legislature , the vogus laws , the courts , the militia officers , the president and the army.
It had a reasonable array of advantages . Slavery was played with loaded dice.
and by way of the Missouri river towns , he fell first among border rouffiand companionship and influences and , perhaps having his inclinations already moulded by his Washington instructions , his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free state cause.
His reception speech at Westport in which he maintained the legality of the legislature and his determination to enforce their laws delighted his pro slavery auditors.
All the territorial dignitaries were present . Governor Shan presided over John Calhoon , the surveyor general , made the principal speech , a gorgeous tiation of the abolitionists supporting the pikamovement Chief justice lacomfdignified the occasion with approving remarks.

The present chapters can only touch upon the more sailient movements of the civil war and cansas which happily are not sanguinary . If , however , the individual and more isolated cases of bloodshed could be described , they would show a startling aggregate of barbarity and a loss of life for opinions sake.
Several hundred free state men promptly responded to the summons.
It was in fact the best weapon of its day.
The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
One of his militia generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at lawrence and elsewhere to surrender the sharp's rifles . Another rod asked him to call out the government troops at Fort Levinworth.
The governor , on his part , becoming doubtful of the legality of employing Missouri militia to enforce cansa laws , was also eagier to secure the help of federal troops.
Sherif Jones had his pockets always full of rids issued in the spirit of persecution that was often baffled by the sharp wits and ready resources of the free state people and sometimes defied outright.
Little by little , however , the latter became himd and bound in the mashes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials involved from the bogas laws.
To embarrass this damaging exposure , judge Lacamp issued a red against the ex - governor on a frivolous charge of contempt.
The incident was not biolent nor even dramatic . No position was summoned , no further effort was made and the reader , fearing personal violence , soon fled in disguise.
but the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free state men were insurrectionists and outlaws.
From these again sprang barricated and fortified dwelling camps on scolp parties finally cuminating in roving gerilla bands half partisan , half predatory.
Their distinctive characters , however , display one broad and unfailing difference.
The free state men follow to their prairie towns and prairie veins with all the obstinancy and courage of trudyfenders of their homes and firesides.
Their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities.

The free state hotel , a stone building and dimensions fifty by seventy feet , three stories high and handsomely furnished , previously occupied only for loging rooms on that day for the first time , opened its table accommodation to the public and provided a free dinner and honor of the occasion.
As he had promised to protect the hotel , the reassured citizens began to laugh at their own fears.
To their sorrow , they were soon undeceived. .
The military force , partly rabble , partly organized , had meanwhile loved the town.
He planted a company before the hotel and demanded a serrender of the arms belonging to the free state military companies.

Captain Martin said , I shall give you a pistol to help you protect yourself if worse comes to worse .
In the early morning of the next day , at twentynine , a company of dragdons with one empty saddle came down from the fort and while the pro slavery man was still sleeping , the prisoner and his escort were on their way across the prairies to tecompton in charge of officers of the united states army.

Well , the former told us that their Scottish peminenters were secretly forming a union with the English parliament and incalcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking . The latter still believed that every such tempt would precipitate them into intermeasures to which otherwise they were not perhaps in cline.
The kings ' ears were now open to Montrose's counsels , who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in Scotland.
Five hundred men more who had been levied by the covernanters where persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack Lord Elco , who lay it perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the Irish invasion.
dreading the superior power of Ourgile , who having joined his vassels to a force levied by the public , was approaching with a considerable army , Montrose hastened northward in order to rouse again the marquie of huntly and the gordens who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the comenenters.
This nobleman's character , though celebrated for political courage and conduct , was very low for military prowess and , after some scirmishes in which he was worsted , he allowed montras to escape him.
By quick marches through these inaccessible mountains , that general freed himself from the superior forces of the cominenters.
With these and some reinforcements of the Ethol men and mcdonalds whom he had recalled , montrase fell suddenly upon our guiles country and let looce upon it all the rage of war , carrying off the cattle , burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword.
This suverity by which Montrose sullied his victories was the result of private and emosity against the chieftaon as much as of zeal for the public cause . Our guil collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay in a locky supposing himself still at her considerable distance from them.
by a quick and unexpected march on , Tros hastened to inelocky and presented himself in order of battle before the suprised but not a frightened covernantes.
His conduct and presence of mind in this emergance appeared conspicuous.
Mantrose , weak in cavalry here , lined his troops of horses with infantry and , after putting the enemy's horse to route fell with united force upon their feet who were intirely cut in pieces , though with the loss of the gallant Lord Gordon on the part of the royalists.
The same men knew regiments and new companies were formed , different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independenc could rely on.
Besides members of parliament who were excluded , many officers were unwilling to serve under the new generals through their commissions un wearily cilitated the project of putting the army finally into the hands of that faction.
They the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible . A more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders.
Valor indeed was very generally deffused over one party as well as the other . During this period , discipline was also attained by the forces of the parliament , but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seemed still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting.
Historians , at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience , have not remarked on any thing but a head long impetuous conduct , each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determined the success.
He passed through Henley Sint Albans and came as near to London as Harrow on the hill.
The Scottish generals and commissioners were very surprised at the appearance of the king and , though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity , they instantly set a bare upon him under the colour of protection and may him in reality a prisoner.
They informed the English parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king.

If any still retained rancer against him in his present condition , they passed in silence while his wellwishes , more generous than prudent , accompanied his march with tears with hatclamations and with prayers for his safety.

The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise.
What is called perception differs from sinsation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associated images and expectations of their usual coreletes all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation.
Whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions , everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth , though the word exactly might seem like an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that I das proximately represent impressions.
and what sort of evidence is logically possible.
There is no logical impossibility in the hygh pothesis that the world spring into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past.
All that I am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember.
The behaviourest who attempts to make psychology record of behavior has to trust his memory and make the record.
Habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times . If the behaviorist is confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit , that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times.
but I do not think such an ifference is warranted.
Our confidence or lack of competence in the accuracy of a memory image must , in most cases , be based upon a characteristic of the image itself . sense we cannot avoke the past botily and compare it with the present image.
We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust . For example , under the influence of fatigue , we may see a French face vividly and clearly but horibly distorted.
Some images , like some sensations , are very familiar while others are strange.
Familiarity is a filling capable of degrees.
In an image of a well - known face , for example , some parts may feel more familiar than others . When this happens , we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts.
I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to count for our knowledge of the past.
They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.
In actual fact , there are doubtless various factors that can cur and give us the filling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event.
There may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pastness , especially where immediate memory is concerned.
There is , of course , a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of fiellings giving their critical relation to the present , but it is clear that such fillings must play a sential part in the process of dating remembered
If we had retained the subject or act in knowledge , the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple.
Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or close to what is remembered.
Some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
and in this case , as in most others , what may be taken in advance is rather vague.
The first of our vague but intubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
We might provisionally , although perhaps not quite correctly , define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue and our knowledge of the future . Such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned , though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy.
This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory , but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory.
A grammaphone with the help of seuitable records that relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramiphones as they like to believe.
I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before , such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be a holly habit that enables me to do this.
The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.
semmons to books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely.
They give waws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images referr to past occurrences , which is what constitutes knowledge memory.
It is this that is a venturost to the theory of knowledge.
It is by no means always reliable . Almost everybody has at some time experienced the well - known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.
Whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object , it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object , which leads us to the judgment this is familiar.
Thus , no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
A further stage is recognition.
direcognition and this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of sociation the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.
We are , of course , in fact , able to judge when we recognize the object that we have seen before , but this judgment is something over and above recognition in the first sense and may very probably be impossible for animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sence of the word.
This knowledge is memory in one sense , though in others it is not.
There are , however , several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with . It might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as I have seen this before than as this has existed before.
The definition of my experience is difficult . Broadly speaking , it is everything that is conducted with what I am experiencing now by certainlangks of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.
Thus , if I recognize this thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it forms part of my experience , by definition , the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single oubt from the rest of the world.
Of course , the words that existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition , but that is unavoidable when they are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means permitive and is quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as it recognition.
I stayed there alone for many hours , but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.
Had Cress Weller not been good looking , had Jack Ban still in college , had Sir Kennyton Obal remained in Angland , had Mister Bunnet and the barkeeper had not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill , should I have succeeded in a rating for the final departure of my old friend.
On arriving home and my own residence , I found that our calon was filled with brilliant company.
As I spoke I made him a gracious bow and I think I showed him by my mote of address that I did not bear any grudge as to my individual self.
I have come to your Mister President with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this disin quarter of the world.
We have our little shruggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rosewater.
We are quite satisfied now , Captain battle ax , said my wife.
quite satisfied , said eva.
The ladies and compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic , are on one hand and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other.
No doubt the process of time the ladies will follow.
Their masters said Missus never bend.
I did not mean said captan battllax though touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this.
Missus never been , you should be proud of your son.
Jack was standing in the fourth corner of the room talking to Eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises.
Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player , said my wife.
Ai and my wife and son and the two cress wellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship the next. day .
This I felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and I endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might fit the occasion , but I could not ufeel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life.
My wife , at the moment , managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner.
This , she said , was true hospitality and I am not sure that I did not agree with her
Then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives , who were , for the most part , the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.
Oh yes , said jack and i'm nowhere.
but I mean to have my innings before long.
of what Missus had never gone through and providing birds , beasts and fish not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day . No one but myself can have any idea , but it must be admitted that she achieved her task with thorough success.
We sat with the officer for some little time after dinner and then went ashore.
How much evil and real accomplished evil had not occurred to me during the last few days.
What can I do now but just lay myself down and die.
and the death of which I hope could not alas.
When this captain should have taken himself and the vessel back to England , I would retire to a small form which I possessed on the other side of the island and there in seclusion would end my days.
Jack would become a happy husband and would remain amist the hurried duties of the eager world.
Thinking of all this , I went to sleep.
Mister never bend began the captain and I observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president . It cannot be thenined that we had come here on an unpleasant mission.
You have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character and English stand so high.
It is a duty , said I.
But your power is so superior to any that I can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yield to it.
Not a doubt , but had your force been only double or trouble our own , I should have found it my duty to struggle with you.
That is all quite true , Mister never been , said Sir Ferdmand Obran.
I can afford to smile because I am absolutely parilous before you , but I do no less feel that in a matter which the progress of the world is concerned , I or rather we have been put down by brute force.
You have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction.
Therefore , I feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a kourtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally.
I can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since I was bored
Then said Sirferd nando there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him.
There was a sudden shock when I heard these words which exceeded anything which I had yet felt.
You hear what Sir fer mand o Brown has said , replied Captain Battle Ax.
But what is the delicate mission ? asked.
I was to be taken away in carriageto England or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage and it mattered not which

What worldwide inniquity such a speech as that thescloseves said , I was still turning myself to the captain , for though I would have crushed them both with my words had been possible , my dislike sentured itself after mando.
You will allow me to suggest that him , but that is a matter of opinion.
I had complied with your orders without expressing my own opinion . I should seem to have done so willingly hereafter.
The letter ran as follows.
Sir , I n't recommend informing your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the Crown colony which is called Britain Yula.
The procurlar circumstances of the colony are within your knowledge.
But in their selection of a constitution , the British uless have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprong their present difficulties.
It is found in the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life in which men cease to work.
but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of entering at once with your governor.
John Brik is armed with a weapon of Greek power against which it is impossible for the people of Britain , Yulo , to prevail.
You will carry out with you one hundred men of the north northwest Burmingham regiment , which will probably suffice for your own security , as it is thought that mister never been withdrawn , the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience.
When do you intend for John Bright to start.
Today I watched

I shall be happy to take charge of them , said Sirfern Ando.
They , of course , must all be auter.
or of the habits of our people , it is quite impossible.
Your paret is sufficient , I said.
If you will give us your promise to meet Captim Adlax here at this time morrow , we will stretch a point and delay the departure of John Bright for twenty four hours.
and this plan was adopted too in order to ebxtract from me a promise that I would depart in peace.
This was what made the mistake so far as running away was concerned.
It is hardly necessary to say more of them here.

Three seconds before the arrival of John Hobson's letter , I knew more dreams of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage.
Even so , I had just returned from a dangerous journey exhausted and badly needing a rest.
I wanted nothing more than to see my country again , my friends , my modest quarters by the batanical gardens , my dearly beloved collections.
but now nothing could hold me back.

Our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate I rushed to board.
I asked her commander faragot.
One of the sailors led me to the apartment deck where I stood in the presence of a smart looking opficer who extended his hand to me.
In person , welcome a boay professor . Your cabin is waiting for you.
I was satisfied with my cabin , which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's mess.
Well , be quite comfortable here , I told the conseil.
and so if I had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less , the friend would have gone without me and I would have missed out on this unearthly , extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism.

As soon as they entered the room of the great nife , the booloroo gave a yellow disappointment.
The room of the great nigfe was high and big and around it ran rose of benches for the spectators to sit upon.
The one blaye at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant hrowne chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but rechly o post her tars for the snomnows princesses.
Therefore , her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her.

The captain shook his head.
Why did you sit ton fetch the first living pressure we met and that was this pilling oat replied , the captain , panting hard as he held vast to one of the goats worns.
The idea of patching cap'n buill to a goat was very amusing to him and the more he thought of it , the more he roared with laughter.
There was something alike , you know , suggested the captain of the guards looking for one to the other doubtfully and there was nearly the same size of high stande boat on their high legs . They both got the same style of whiskers and they were both of them obstinate and dangerous , so they ought to make a good put landed.
fine porious.
When this had been accomplished , the boolaro leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before.
At once , the goat gave a leap escape from the soldiers and with a bowed head rushed upon the booloroo.
Before any good could stop him , he butted his majesty so furiously that the king 's sword farine into the air and tumbled in a hape among the benches where he lay moni and growning.
The goats wore like spirits were roused by the successful attack.
Then they made great haste for the door and the went to an end , but that sent the row of royal nadies all diving into the corridor in another tangle , whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified every wone within the sound of their voices.
I had a notion it was you made them tell me from the nife.
I did shuv much being bound so tight , but when I was lomes talking to her , just swung good shiver to relieve my feelings.
coming to the bollero , she going toward the benches.
So they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of symbols told trot and cat'n bill that the blue bands had assimpled before the palace.
Then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkyes had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them.
At the head of the pinkies were Gissesl and Embright , who had a parot on his shoulder and there was supportede by kept in correly and Captain Tentent and Rosily the witch.
When the blue scann saw gipcuses old day rased and another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people.
Since last yesterday I have all been the lawful boolooroo of the Blue Country , but now that you are conquered by Quinn shot , I suppose I am conquered too and do have no boolaru at all.
When he fased she said cheerfully.
Don't worry Sizzol dear , it will all come right pretty soon.
Now then let 's enter the city and enjoy the great feast of being pooked unnearly starm ma . So for this conqering kingdom is hard work.
Then she gave Rosaley back her magic , telling her thank her the kindness for all she had done for them.
You are mate , replied the sailor.
That will be such a satisfaction.
The guard had a terrible struggle with the goat which was looseen the room and still wanted to fight , but finally they subdued the animal and bheen they took the bulloroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both ham and the goat before the queen trot , who awaited them in the throne room ot the palace.
I 'll gladly do that promised the new booloroo and I'll feed the honorable go all the shavings and leather and tinkans he can eat besides the grass.
xcuse me said , I want to tell you that you're not the booaroo any more.
The former boolori groaned.
Ho not be wicked any more sided the old booleroo how to reform.
As a private citizen I shall be a moddle of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise.
When first they arrived in the throne room , they tried to be haughty and scornful as ever , but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and deared them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the pencess of the least little bit.
So Gissis r ordered the cattain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home.
That evening , travel gave a grand ball and the palace to which the most important of the pinkies in the blue skins were invited.
The combined bands of both countries played the music and a fine menu was served.

die by you how we might stroll towards death . How only music one another preath through gardens intimate with holly howks where silent poppies burned between the rocks by pools where birches ben to confidance above green waters surrounded by the lily plants.
vinnice.
an a sun sat glowing in crimson and gold she lies the glory of the world . The beached kings ' galley whose sails are furled who is hung with tabistries Ric and old.
The pity that we must come and go.
while the old gold and the marble stays forever gleaming a soft strong blaze in the early evening glow.
The pleasant gravyard of my soul with sentimental cybris trees and flowers is filled that I may stroll in meditation at ease.
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high.
Over the track lined city streets the young men grenning pass.
Home ye sails that seemed to wonder in dream filled medows say is the shore where I stand the only fieled of struggle or is he hit and battered out there by waves and wingusts as he teg over a clashing sea of watery achos.
old dances are simplified by their yearning bleached ba time.
He had got into her courtyard.
Through the black night rain he sang to her window bars.
That was but the rustling of tripping plants in the dark.
She was alone that night.
He had broken into her curtyard.
to fade in a way like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of a danna , her soft voices herd and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning due.
Oh life of this spring.
Why fates the loduce of the water.
How afraid are these children of the spring.
fell is like a watry bow and like a parting cloud , like a reflection in a glass , like shadows in the water , like dreams of infants , like a smile upon its infants ' face.
With the duve's voys like transient day , like music in the air ah.
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of him that walket in the guarden in the evening time.
The lily of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered , the lovely maiden said I am a watcery weed and I am very small and love to dwell in lowly vails so weak the gilded butterfly scarce purches on my head , yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the balley and each mourn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou newborne bluoly flower.
thou gentle maide of silent valleys and of modest brooks , for thou shall be clothed in te light and fed with morning mana till summer heat mounts thee beside the fountains and the springs te flourish in aternal veiles they should complain.
Why should the mistress of the veils of har ater asig.
She seased and smiled and cried , then sat down in her silver shrine.
which thou dust scatters on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milk cow andtams the fire breathing steed.
but thou his like a faint cloun kindled that the rising sun I vanished from my pearly throne and who shall find my place.
and why it scatters its bright beauty through the humid air.
descend a little cloud and hovfer before the eyes fell.
o little cloud the virgin said , I charge le to tell me why thou complaints now when in one hour thou fadaway then we shall seek me but not . Ah fell is like to thee.
I passed away , yet I complain and no one hears my voice.
The cloud then showed his golden head and his bright formemurge.
and feierce thou because I fanish and am seen no more.
It is too ten fold life til love to peace and ractures holely unseen descending way my light wings upon bomy flowers and court the fair eye do to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen son.
till we arise linked in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all tender flowers.
lives not alone nor of theirs fear not and I will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice.
come forth worm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen.
The helpless warm rose sat upon the lilyes leaf and the bright cloud sailed on defined his partner in the veil.
image of weakness art thou but a worm.
I see they lay helpless maket weeping and none to answer , none to cherish them with their mother's smiles.
and says thou mother of my children , I have loved them and I have given them a crown that none can take away.
and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot.
or an eye of gifts and graces showering fruits and cointed goal.s
Why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind.
Why in ear a whirld pool so fierce to draw creations in.
all is said without a word.
I sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy islads from an unaverd yet pronicle inward joy.
I did not wrong myself , but I placed a wrong on them .
When I called before , I told him how hastily I dropped my flowers or broke off from a game.
Showiy never missed hometolk and blessing and the common kiss the cons to each turn nor count it strange when I look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this.
Alas , I have grieved , so I am heard to love.
open thy heart wide and fold within the wet wings of the idove.
Good it means to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow.
Nay , I was rather thrilled , distrusting every light that seemed to guarantee an onward path and feare to overlean a finger even.
and though I have grown serene and strong since then , I think that God has willed a still renewable fear.
Oh love oh troth.
and love be false.
If he is to keep one oath , he must lose one joy but his life's star to Tole.
slow to world greedings quick with its litst when the angel speak.
a ring of amethist I could not wear here to my sight then that first kiss.
That was the crism of love which loves own crown.
Dearest teach me so to pour outgratitude as thou dust good.
musclemens and guyords throw curchefs with a smile and half no ruth for any weeping.
But thou art not such a lover , my beloved.
Thou can't wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late.
I think all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine.
Oh to shoot my soul's full meaning into the future that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endurers from life that disappears.
Then I long tried by natural ills received comfort quickly . While budding at thy sight , my pilgrim staff gave out green bleas with morning doomed impearal.
I love them freely as men strive for . I loved Teep purely as they turned from prays.
I loved them with the passion put to yuse in my old friends and with my childhood's faith.
I loved them with a love Ie seemed to lose with my lost saints . I loved them with the breath smile teared all my life and if god toose I would love the better after death .
