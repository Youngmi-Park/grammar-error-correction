The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
Soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding.
The unknown faces passed him by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference , a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face.

You will find me continually speaking of formen tision hole bine turner and tin cutet using almost the same terms.
the united every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorests sometimes as kirus scuruss.
By being studious about color , they are studious about division and while the curoscurest devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light , the colorests have for their function the attainment of beauty by rangement of the divisions of light.
My first principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of lang portions of distinct hue side by side.
Some of the touches indeed when the tenteras are mixed with water have been laid in little drops of pands so that the pigment might crystalize hard at the edge.

Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonizes with the other hues , it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than white paper and that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds and the round window will tell as jeels if they are gradated justly.

do not therefore think that gothic schools are an easy job .
The law of that school is that everything should be seen clearly or at least only in such a faintness as shall be delightful and I have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground.
This at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative , that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that , in fact , your producing jewelers work rather than pictures.
that astyle as restrained or severe does not mean that it is also a runius.
In all English gothic art indeed you will find failures of this kind , especially distortion and regidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid ropose of classical art.
The large letter contains entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that are merely child ish in failing work of an inferior hand . It is not characteristic of gothic or any other school.
but observe you can only do this on one condition , that of striving to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination.

It was this observation tha was true from Douglas then altomediately but later in the evening , reply that had the interesting consequence to which I called attention.

He cretted the fire and dropped back into his chair.

It was almost the tone of hope everybody would stay.

Missus Grisfin , however , expressed her need for a little more light.

For if I don't know who she was in love with , I know who he was.
let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what I shall presently give.
poar dogbess before his death , when it was in he committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our husband to a little circle on the night of the fourth
The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't , of course , thank heaven stay . They departed in consequence of arrangements made in a range of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up.
The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a manner fe gun.
He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase , but it was to his country home and old family place in Essex that he wished immediately proceed.
The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relationship and that his own affairs took about as much time.
There were plenty of people to help , but , of course , the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority.
I don't anticipate.
She was young . I'm nervous . It was a vision of serious duties and little company for really great loneliness .
hehs but that's just the beauty of her passion.
It was the beauty of it.
It sounded dull , sounded strange and all the worse because of his main condition which was.
She promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when , for a moment , thisburdent delighted , he held her hand , thanking her for the sacrifice . She already felt rewarded.
but it was all her reward when one of the ladies asked.
how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the groth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that throwh its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child.
God , as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished , had given her a lovely child whose place was in that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parents for ever with the race and descent of morals and to be finely a blessed soul in heaven.
yet these thoughts affected him less with hope than apprehension.
The child had a native grace which does not embariably coexist with faultless beauty . It's a tire , however simple , always impresse the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best.
This outward newt ability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life.
hester putd only account for the child's character and even then , most vagally ends imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from the material of earth.
They were now alluminated by the morning radionce of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storms and whor awind.
However , nevertheless , the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of being on the side of undue soverity.
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes , she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant and mortality that was committed to her charge.
As to any other kind of discipline , whether addrest to her mind or heart , little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordnace with the kaprice that rolled the moment.
It was a look so intelligent yet anexplicable perverse , sometimes so malicious but generally accompanyed by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not believe , questioning such moments whether pearl was a human child.
Beholding it she was constrained to rushing towards the child to pursue the little elph in the flight which she envariably began to snatch her to her bosom with close pressure and earnest kisses , not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that the pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive.
Brooding over all these matters , the mother felt like one who had a voke to spirit , but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration had failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence.
Parl was a born outcast of the inventile world.
Parl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance.
When spoken to she would not speak again.
hester print went one day to the mansion of Governor Belling Ham with a pair of bloves which she had frnged and emboidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused the sformer ruler to descend a step for two from the highest rank he still held and honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy.
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves , inpelled him at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the suttlement.
In that epic of pristine simplicity , however , matters of even slighter public interest and a further less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state.
The period was hardly at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property to a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature.
We have spoken of the pearl's rich and luxjoriant beauty , a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints , a bright complexion , eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black.
It was the scarlet letter in another form , the scarlet letter down with life.
The mother herself as if the red ignomine were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions of its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid in genuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture.
But in truth , all was one well as the other and only inconsequence of that identity had been contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance.
Come therefore and let us sling mud at them.
but Perl , who was a dauntless child , after frowning , stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures , suddenly made a rush at the of her enemies and put them all to flight.
She screamed and shouted too , with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them.
It was further decorated with strange and seemingly capolistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when laid on and had now grown hard and doorable for the admiration of later times.
They approached the door , which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projecton of adofice in both of which were latis windows the wooden shutters to close over them at needed
Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prin gave a summons which was answered by one of the governors ' bond servants , a free - born English man but now a seven - year old slave.

with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials , diversity of climate and different modes of social life , Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of Faras state in his native land.
On the table and tokened at the sentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind , stood a large puter tankered at the bottom of which , had hester or pearl peeped into it , they might have seen the frothy rumnant of a recent draft of aile.
little pearl , who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontous piece of the house , spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate.
mother cried " She I see you here look look.
And honestly , she seemed absolutely hidden behind it.
Fearl , accordingly , ran to the bowindow at the further end of the hall and looked along the viste of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and invetor attempt at shrubery.
but the proprietor appeared already to have reelinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic on a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence , the native English taste for ornamental gardening.
There were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees , probably the descendents of those planted by the reverend Mister Blackstone , the first settler of the penincula that half mithological personage who rides through our early annals on the back of a ball.
Pearl seing the rose bushes began to cry for our red rose and would not be passified.
He had blue silk stockings , blue nee pans with gold buckles , a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braded with gold.
His hat had a peaked crown with a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved.
Instead of shoes , the old man wore boots with turnover tops and a blue coat that had wide cuffs of gold braid.
For a long time , he had wished to explore the beautiful and of os in which they lived.
When they were outside , they simply laphed the door and started up the path.
No one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone.
At the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the Monchkins from the country of the Gillickans , the path divided.
He knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was there nearest neighbour.
All morning they trudged up the mountain path and in the afternoon unk and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket.
then they started on again and two hours later came the sight of the house of doctor pipped.
all connected at the door of the house and a chubby , pleasant - faced woman dressed in blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile.
I am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home.
We have come from a lonely place than this leer place.
and you must be unlucky , she added.
Oh Jo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life.
When travelling , ojo and I stayed at your house just to rest and werefresh ourselves.
The woman seemed thoughtful.
and at one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row , all bubbling and steaming at a great rate.
It took me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment I am pleased to say it is nearly done . You see , I am making it for my good wife Margaralot , who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own.
You must know said margalot when they were allseated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old Mumbe the witch who used to live in the country of te gillikins to the north of here.
The first loct we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since.
I think the next glass cat that a magician makes will have neither brains nor a heart , for then it will not object to catching mise and they will prove of some use to us.
I think I don't know much about the land of
Yousee I 've lived allmy life with a nonkey the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything.
That is one reason you are also unlucky , said the woman in a sympathetic tone.
I think I must show you my patch work , " girl said without laughing at the boys ' ostonishment because she is rather difficult to describe .
But first I will tell you that for many years I have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cok the meals and wash the dishes.
yet that task was not as easy as you may think .
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colours of cloth so together.
Sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up.
When I found Id , I said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is , for such a dreadful mixture of colours would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchgins are.
In the emerald city where our princess alsimalives green is the popular color.
I will show you what a good job I did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.
Oh Jo wexamined this serious contrivance with wonder.
Margalot had first made the girls form from the patch work quiled and then she had dressed it with the patch work skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same game material throughout
The head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her.
The hair was af brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat brains.
Gold is the most common metal in the land of os and is used for many purposes because it is soft and andpliable.
No I forgot about about the brains , exclaimed the woman.
Well , that may be true , agreed margaloc , but in contrast , a servat with too many brains is sure to become pendent in high and mighty and feel above her work.
She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.
I think that will continue because the other qualities are not needed in a servant.
She ran to her husband 's side at once and helped him lift the forecattles from the fire.
Their contents had all boiled away , leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder.
very carefully , the magician removed this powder , placing it together in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon.
No one saw him doing this , for all was looking at the powder of life , but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard.
Oh , Jo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish , but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness.
He selected a small gold bottle with a pepperbox top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes.
Most people talk too much , so it is a relief to find someone who talks too little.
I am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement , he told his visitors as he lit a pipe with a crookin stem and began to smoke.

The grateful applause of the clergy has consequated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest.
The edict of Milane , the great charter of toleration , had confirmed to every individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion.

Some of the penal regulations were copied from the enics of dictionaries and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had taken the hand of appression and pleated for the rights of humanity.
They asserted with confidence and almost with exultation , that the opostolical succession was interrupted , that all the bishops of Europe and Asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the perogatives of the Catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the African believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline.

If a rock or a rivilat or a bit of earth harder than comman severed the links of the clue , they followed the true eye of the scout , recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary.
extinguished brands were lying around a spring , The awfuls of a dear were scattered about the place and the trees wore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses.
A circle of a few hundred feet of sircumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion.
The examination , however , resulted in no discoveries .
The whole party crowded to the spot where uncaspointed out the impression of a mocuson in the moist illuvion.
run back on coston brought me the size of the singer's foot.
notwithstanding the high resolution of howkay he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to encur.
In his return to the camp , his acute and practiced intellects were intently engaged in divising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree in ferior to his own.
In other words , while he had implicit faith in the ability of bailem's to speak , he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs.
There was something in his air and demanner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind.
The ingenious hawky who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation.
The bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well - known voice replied.
Can these things be returned ? David breathing more freely as the truth began to down upon him.
Come com returned Hocki and casing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion . You may see a skin which if it is not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business.
The young man is in bondage and I fear his death is decreed.
I greatly morned that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and I have sought a goodly him can you lead me to him.
The task will not be difficult . David hesitating though I greatly fear your presence would rather increase the mitigate his unhappy fortunes.
The lodgein which uncus was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation.
Four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison , uncus wary but close observers of the manner of their captive.
delivered a strong tone of a cent announced the gratification the savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared.
They drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter.
but the bear , instead of obeying , maintained the seat it had taken and growled.
The cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow up on his brothers and take away their courage too , continued David , improving the hand he received so they must stand further off.
Then , as if satisfied with their safety , the scout left his position and slowly entered the building .
It was silent and gloomy , being tenanted solely by the captive and lit by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cooquery.
onkus occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful withs.
The scout , who had left David at the door to ascertain they were not observed , thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
What shall we do with the mingoes at the ? They count six and the singer is as good as nothing.
The delawares are children of the tortise and they outstrippe the deer.
oncus who had already approached the door and was readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the room .
but Hawk , who was too occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement , continued speaking more to himself than to his companion.
So onchus you had better take the lead while I will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed.
Well , what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention.
As soon as these decisions were made , the scout turned to dance and gave him his parting instructions.
My pursuits are peaceful and my temper I humbly trust as greatly given to mercy and love returned David a little nettle that so direct and attack on his menhood but there are none who can say that I have ever forgotten my faith in the Lord , even in the greatest straits.
If you are not knocked on the head , being a non compasor will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed.
So consider for yourself to make a rush or worry here.
bravely and generously has battled on my behalf and this and more will dare in his service.
keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out loudly and one of your shoutings will serve to remind the Indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be.
If they take your scoup , I trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and I will not forget the deed but revenge it as they become true warriors and trusty friends.
hold said David , prceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him . I am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge.
Then heving a heavy sigh , probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned . He added it is what I would wish to practice myself as one without a cross of blood , though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian.
God bless you friend . I do believe your send is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping a turnity before the eyes , though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation.
The delaware dog , he said , leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the others ' features is afraid.
will the herens hear his groans.
The moheacan started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort.
He had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of chries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village.
ongess cast a skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.
I will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned.
I had always known him to be restless in his manner , but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrol belegitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred.
My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.
Without his scrapbooks , his chemicals and his homely antidiness he was an uncomfortable man.
I had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct.
I was absent for more than an hour.
The only dupikat which existed so far as I knew it was that which belonged to my servant banister , a man who had looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion.
The moment I looked at my table , I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers.
The proof was in three long slips I had left them all together.
It all turned out out that someone passing had observed the key in the door , had known that I was out and had entered to look at the papers.
I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while I did a most careful examination of the room.
A broken tip of lead was lying there also.
not only this , but on the table I found a small ball of black or clay with specks of something which looked like sawdust in it.
Above all things , I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.
To the best of my belief , they were rolled up.
Did no one know that these proofs would be there ? No one saved the printer.
I was in such a hurri to come to you , you left your door open.
so it seems to me.
Now mister Sulmbs at your disposal.
above wore three students , one on each story.
Then he pproached it and , standing on tipto with his neck craned , he looked into the room.
There is no opening except the one paitine said our learned guide.
I am afraid there are no signs here , said He.
One could hardly hope for any upon a rainy day.
You left him in a chair you say which was by the window there.
The man entered and took the papers shed by shet from the central table.
As a matter of fact , he could not say solmes because I entered by the side door.
How long it takes to do that using every possible contraction acquarter of an hour not less.
then he tassed it down and seized the next
He was in the midst of that when his return caused him to make a very hurried retreat , since he had no time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.
Mister Salmas was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.
homs held out a small chip with the letters an an and the space of clear wood after them , you see.
what's a Ni has always done you and injustice there are others.
I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polishe surface . No I see nothing.
as homes drew the curtain I was aware of some little regidity and anlertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency.
Holms turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor . Hello what is this.
homes hut ed out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.
What could he do ? He caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.
I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stare and are in the habit of passing your door . Yes there are.
and they are all in for the examination yes.
One heartly likes to throw suspicion where there is no proofs.
Let us have the suspicions I will look after the proofs.
My scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious . He will do well.
The top floor belongs to males . mcclerin.
I do not go so far as that , but of the three , he is perhaps the least unlikely.
He was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life.
but I have occasionally done the same thing at other times.
Did you look at these papers on the table.
how came you left the key in the door.
any one in the room could get out yes sir.
I really don't think he knew much about Mister Holmes.
only for a minute or so.
Oh I would not venture to say Sir.
you haven't seen any of them no sir.
It was the Indian whose dark silouett appeared suddenly upon his blind.
He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.
The set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them.
no names please said Holmes as we knocked at Gilchris door.
Of course , he did not realize that it was y who was nocking but nonetheless his conduct was very uncourteous and , indeed , under the circumstances , rather suspicious.
That is very important to homes.
You don't seem to realize the position.
to Morrow for the examination.
I can n't allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with . The situation must be faced.
It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.
I will take the black clar with me alsor the pennil cuttings good bye.
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows.
the French moute fellow at the top.
He is the one with the worst record.
Why benister the servant what's his game in the matter.
He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.
My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation.
No good my dear watson.
I think you have formed a conclusion.
Yes my dear Watson , I have solved the mystery.
look at that , he held out his hand.
On the palm were three little pyramids of black dohy clay.
and one more this morning.
In a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the colprit to compete for the valuable scholarship.
He could hardly stand still , so great was his mental egitation and he ran towards home with two eager hands outstretched , thinking heaven that you have come.
You know him , I think so.
If this matter is not to become public , we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial.
No sir certainly not.
There was no man sir.
His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon the banister and the farther corner.
Just close the door said homes.
We want to know Mister Gilchrist how you and honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday.
For a moment , Gil Christ with upraised hand tried to control his riving features.
Come come say holme's kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.
Well , I'll not have trouble answering listen and see that I do you know and justice.
he could examine the papers in his own office.
In addition , I also thought nothing about it .
When I approached your room , I examined the window.
No one less than that would have a chance.
I entered and I took you into my confidence as to these suggestions on the side table.
He returned carrying his jumping shoes , which are provided as you are , with several sharp spikes.
No harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he prceived the keey which had been left by the carelessness of your servant.
A sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs.
He put his shoes on the table.
gloves , said the young man.
Suddenly , he heard him at the very door . There was no possible escape.
However , I told the truth to Mister Gilgrust.
I have a letter here Mister Solmes which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night.
It would be clear to you from what I have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you were out.
It was simple enough sir if you only had known , but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know.
If Mister Solm saw them , the game was up.
In the debate between the singiers societies , her defense of the fifteenth amendment was not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm.
The South she had not thought of seriously and yet , knowing of its delightful hospitality and miled climate , she was not a verse to Charleston or New Orleans.
John Taylor , who had supported her through college , was interested in cotton.
better go he had counseld antentiously.
might learn something useful down there.
But John there's no society , just elementary work.
been looking up Toomb's country
fine some crustwells there big plantations raded two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Some others too bid Cottond county.
You ought to know John if I teach Negroes , else I scarcely see many people in my own class.
At any rate , I say go.
Here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused oldors and bodily perspiration was to her , at times , unbearable.
She wants a glance at the new books in periodicals and talk of great ful anthropies and reforms.
So for a hundredh times she was thinking today as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms.
cotton she bassed.
She had almost forgotten that it was here in touch and sight.
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered an murmured before her sretching awit to the northward.
It might be a bit poor here and there , but most of this place was such desperate prose.
her regards shifted to the green stocks and leaves again and she started to move away.
Cotton is a wonderful thing , is it not boyfriend ? she said rather primly.
Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton , but at least one more remark seemed called four.
I don't know if I will have all the things in will comment on Miss Taylor 's letter re Bornin Cotton and well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go.
I suppose it's too early for them . Then came the explosion.
Googles don't grow on the tops of sadvines but on the ground of new ords like yems is so.
The golden fleece the silver fleece he harkened.
Sometimes you tell me please won't you.
Now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy . No not even mat she had been talking , just talking . There were no people in the conversation , just things , one thing taughtme.
The honorable Chales Smith , Miss Sara's brother , was walking swiftly up and down from Mister Easterley's wallstreet office and his face was pale.
Finally , the cotton combine was to all appearances in assured fact and he was slated for the senate.
Why should he not be like other men.
She was not herself a notably intelligent woman . She greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others.
As she awaited her guess , she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and as quiet tude for her social functions were few to night there . She checked them off on her fingers . Sir James Criton , the rich English menufacturer and lady criton mister and Missus Vanderpol , Mister Harry Creswell an hiss sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guess that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of coden interests earlier in the day.
Missus Gray had met Southerners before , but not intimately and she always had in mind vivid cruelty to poor negroes , a subject she made a point of introducing fourth with.
She was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear Mister Crestwell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education.
Do you believe in some education ? " asked Mary Taylor.
I believe in training people to their capacity . The Englishmen here hartily seconded him.
but Creswell added significantly copacity diffes in normal li between groups .
The bandor pools were sure of this and the Englishman instancing India became quite eloquent . Missus Gray was mistified but hardly dared admit . The general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest crutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them.
a timley her AWIC added criswell avoiding her sister 's eyes.
but we're not exactly welcome.
Marry Taylor , however , related the tail of Sor to Missus Gray's private ear later.
For tunately , said Mister Vanderfol , the nose and sawtinors all ribing at a belof mutual understanding on most of these matters.
He knew the silver fleese his ansor must be ruined.
It was the first great sorrow of his life . It was not so much the loss of the cousin itself , but the fantasy of the dreams built around it.
Ah the swamp the cruel swamp.
The revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly until it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder.
He wanted to know if she too knew or knew and cared not or cared and knew not.
She was so strange to human beings .
The world was water beiled in the mists.
Then if it was a sudden admid day , the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred . The sgy was like lue steel , the earth steamed.
where was the use of imagining.
The lagood had been level with the dikes a week ago and now.
Perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping.
He started at the thought , he hurried forth sad
He plashed to stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the ramp of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge.
Then he looked down , the lagoon was dry.
He stood a moment bewoldered , then turned and rushed upon the eisland . A great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green , tall , wet and willowy.
The squares of codd a sharp edge were just about to burst into bulls.
But one long moment he paused stupid again with utter amazement , then lane dizzly against the tree.
He gazed about him astonished.
Here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain . Someone had dug a way from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and cocked way , thus allowing it to empty directly.
He sat down in the wildered and one thought was up most soara.
The years days her dying were ten.
The hope and dream of harvest was upon the land.
up in the sick roomes or lay on the little white bed.
The ned and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her . She had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strole for her life wosh narled and creeping fingers , but now , at last , weakly she opened her eyes and questioned.
For a while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure , son , bird and tree.
She , with a fleeting glance , gathered the shawl around her , then glided forward , wavering tremulus slipped across the road and into the swamp.
She had been born within its borders , within his border , she had lived in Groan and within its border she had met her love.
After , she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton laborfore her.
The chair was empty , but he knew
He darted through the trees and pawsed a tall man strong but slimly made.
It is a very fin old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery liken which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables , the windows and the door
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door , I think , is like a gate . It is never opened.
for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonrous bang behind the livery blackey who had just seen as master and misters off the grounds in a carriage and par.
a large opene fireplace with resty dogs in it and a barer boarded floor at the far end , fleeces of wolves sbacked up in the middle of the floor some empty cornbags.
and what through the left hand window.
Several clothes morses , a pillion , a spenning wale and an old box were opened and stuffed full of coloured rags.
At the edge of this box there is a great wooden doll which , so far as mudilation is concerned , bears a strong resemblance to the finest Greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose.
The history of the house is plain now.
but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the couches and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow billed ducks who are seasing the opportunity of gitting the grink with as much body in it as possible.
were the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harnesses under the superintendents of Mister Goby , the woddaw otherwise satdler who entertains them with the latest Tredleston gassap.
She often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned to look at the pleacing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for entertainment than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round peterdishes there were ranged on the shells above the long deal dinner table or in the hobs of the great which always shone like jasper.
Do not suppose , however , that Missus Poyser was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a good looking woman , not more than eight and thirty , a fair complexion and sandy hair with shapen light feet
The family like this between her and her knees Dina Moris with the contrast between her keenness and dinas surrafhic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for Martha and Mary.
Her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a dame sol came with ag or shot seemed to take up an unfinished luxury as a barrel organ takes up a tune exactly at the point where it had left off
The fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have two ows and why I thought Missus Poiser should scold Molly because the house was with unusual severity.
To all appearances , molly had got through her after dinner work in an exemplary manner , had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissivly if she should sit down to her spinning till morning
spinning indeed.
I never knew your equals for gallowsness.
Who taught you to scrub a floor should like to know.
Comb the wolf for the wio ows indeed.
That's what she'd like to be doing
That's the way with you . that's the road you'd all like to go headlong to ruin.
Mister oat lees andeed.
You are a rare ind sitting down to your work a little while after its time to put by.
money My arons told me to put it down to warm.
cald es it my darling . bless your sweet face.
She's going to put the ironed things away.
money I delige to go into the barn to Tomme to see the odd.
No no no tadty bitter feet wet said Missus Poyser , carrying away her iron.
did see the screaming Missus Poyser running towards the table when her ei had fallen on the blue stream.
Toddy , however , had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of wabbling run and an amount of fat on the neieb of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig.
and she was very fond of you too rechel.
I often heard her talk about you in the same sort of way.
He had that bad illness and I was only leven years old . She used to say , You'll have a friend on earth in your Aunt Rachel if I'm taken from you , for she has a kind heart and I'm sure I've found it so.
and there's listening in the house as I could well spare you because I got lots of sheeting and table clothing and towling isn't made up.
but not more than what's in the bible and said Dina.
Maybe and you have never heard me say that all people are called for her sake their work in their families.
We can all be servants of God wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and pulseus to it.
I can no longer help spending my life trying to do what I can for the souls of others . Then you could help running . If you heard little toddy crying at the other end of the house , the voice would go to your heart . You would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her.
I am strong as sincerely that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children or anything I have done.
I didn't preach without direction.
direction.
I had a common patience with you.
By this time , the TWEA gentleman had reached the palings and had got down from his horses . He was playing They meant to come in.
said Mister Irwin with his stately cordiality.
o dot mention it said Miti's poycer.
I driving your kitchen.
poiser is not at home is he ?
said Captain Danny Thorne , sitting himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door.
no sir he isn't He's went to Roseter to see Mister West 's The Factor about the World
but the father in the barn asked if he'd be of any use.
No thank you , I'll just look at the welbs and leave a message about them with your shepherd.
I must come another day and see your husband . I want to have a consultation with him about horses.
for if his anywhere on the farm , we consend for him in a minute.
Oh Sir said Missus Poyser rather larmed You wouldn't like it at all.
but you know more about that than I do sir.
I think I should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place.
I know Marm is in better order than any other within ten miles of us , then as for the kitchen , he added , smiling , I don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it.
By the way , I've never seen your diary . I must see your diary Missus poyser.
This misus poisor said , blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her melt pans and would just his opinion of her by the appearance of her diary .
Oh there is no doubt it's in capital order.
The paris planned like that of the Chrystal palace was a temporary exhibit.
pulonden ply hat was last temporary but not permanent supply before it was torn out . no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels , curches doores and dwellings in the vicinity of Holeburn vioduc.
There Messier's Johnson and Hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in art and secured useful data for the work in New York of which the story has just been told.
The dynamo electric machine was small was robust for under all the changing speeds of waterpower and the pecissitudes of the plant to which it belonged . It continued in active use until eighteen ninety - nine - seventeen years.
Owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal , profitable way of delivering electrical energy to consumers , a son has been frequently spoken of as an annaponent of the alternating courret.
Why if we erect a station at the falls ? It is a great economy to get it up to the city.
There seems no good reason for believing that it will change.
broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them , he is pidyo in cratically upposed to loosen waste methods to plan e vempire that neglects the poor at the gate.
Everything he has done has been amed by the consumption of energy , the contraction of space , the intensification of culture.
For some years , it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against its seriously.
It could not be used for electoral plating or deposition nor could it charge rige batteries , all of which are easily within the ability of the directurrent.
But when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb , a group of dwellings on the outskirts of a remote country resevens or far away , the alternating currents in all elements save its danger was and is ideal.
One was tolerant of shamm on shaddi and nothing would satisfy him that he could not stand cross examination by microscope tube and galvanometer.
Unless he could secure an engine with smoother running and more exact government regulated than those available for his dinamo and lamp , he realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light.
Mister Addison was a leader far ahead of the time.
He obtained the desired speed and loaded it with a friction break , also a regulator of speed , but waited for an indicator to verify it.
Then again , there was no nown way to lupricate an engin for continuous running and Mister Edison and me that as the marine engines started before the ship left New York and continued running until it reached its home port , so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times.
Andison had installed his historic first great central station system in New York on the multiple arch system covered by his first and main invention , which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against the straight to wire system throughout the tree
He soon foresaw that still greater aconomy would be necessary for commercial success , not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities.
The strong position held by the Edison's system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and gave an immediate empothus to incondicent lighting.
It was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when the yield of six or eight lamps to the horse bower was considered subject for congratulation.
The street conductors were of the overhead poll lime construction was stalled by the construction company that had been organized by Adison to build equipped entral stations.
Meanwhile , he had called upon me to make a report of the three systems known in England as the Hopkinsons . Both Doctor John Hopkinson and Mister Edison being independent and vendors at practically the same time.
I think he was perhaps more appreciative that I was of the discipline of the Edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up.
but the plant ran and it was the first of three wire stations in this country.
They were later used as reserve bachines and finally , with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edesonia but they remain in practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty - three.
The arc labp and stalled outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public streetlighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lap might be out through accident.
Evison held that electricity should must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter.
There was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other invettors were also giving the subject thought , the public took it for granted that any thing so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weded and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration.
Hence , the adison electoralitic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities.
The principale employed in the adison electoralitic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to deacompose a chemical substance.
Associated with the simple form of apparatus were various details and refinements to secure regularity of operation , freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit thaft of current or damage.
The standard adison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination and another set be substituted.
In September eighteen eighty - eight , Mister Duw J Jecks read an interesting paper before the American Institute of electrical Engineers on the six years of practical experience he had up to that time with the meter , then more generally in use than any other.
The others have been operations too short enough to show definite results , although they also went quickly to a dividend basis.
In this connection , it should be mentioned that the association of adison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the adnison mader was accurate and that it's use was not expensive for stations anbove one thousand lights and that the best financial results were in variably secured an a station selling current by meter.
the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety - nine and probably up to the close of the century.
He waited to repair the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable , but all in vain.
He felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of job would better better
The problem was solved.
We were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part.
We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.
Here she would stay comfortable and soothed by mom by lovely plants and richardxotics rejoicing the heart of old turn at the gardener who , since poulysfirst raptrous entrance , had taken her into his good graces for all time.
every chance she could speall after practice hours were over and after the clamorest amands of the boys , upon her time fully satisfied , was ceized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers.
Then dear said Missus Witney , You must be kind to her than ever think what it would be like for one of you to be away from home , even among friends.
Somehow , out of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest , this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
But she could only see fhranzie for just one moment.
ol she's always at the piano said fan she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed.
At this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped fronsye.
but she couldn't speak and if the abjasper hadn't caught her just in time , she would have pumbled over backward from the stool fhransy and all.
asked Fhronsie with her little face closed to himself
Now you'll stay crying man say pouly moun't you.
Oh you are the dearest unbest mother King I ever saw , but how did you make mammy let her come.
Isane splendid cried jasper and intense pride swelled up because father knew how to do it.
There there he said , soothingly , patting her brown blus head.
I know gasped polly andtrolling her sobs . I wo only thank you.
asked Franzie and intense interests slipping down out of Poly's arms and crowding up close to Jasper's side.
Yes , all alone by himself , asserted jasper beemently and winking periously to the others to stop their laughing . He did now truly proncy.
ar no job I must go by my very own self.
ber japp you've got it lapped percy while the other screamed beside Jasper space.
Don't mind it , Polly whispered , Jasper was her fault.
Dear me jaculated the old gentleman to the utmost amazement and at such a time as I had to get her here too.
how did her mother ever let her go.
she asked impulsively . I didn't believe you could persuade her father.
I would not have any fears if I worked , said the old gentleman complacently.
He cried and highdanced just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his personality .
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time.
Finally , he came out of them and wiped his face vigerously.
It was sixteen years ago John Burk died.
His wife now lies beside him and the light shaft that marked their graves bleams across the wheat fields.
From the nor wegon brave yard , one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of sweat and corn , light and dark , dark and light.
From the grave yard gate one pen and a dozen gayly painted farmhouses , the deldid weather vains on the big red barns work at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields.

He was a splendid figure of a boy talm and straight as a young pine tree with his handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow.
That's not much of a job for an athlete here . I've been to town and back.

she gathered up her reins.
Please wait for me Marie Amiel tokes.
I never see loose sih over here.
How brown you've got since you came home . I wished I had an attached to Mammy 's orchard.
I get wet to my knees when I go down to pic carries.
Indeed , he had looked away with the purpose of noxseing it.
They think you are proud because you've been away from school or something.
There was something individual about the great farm , a most unusual trimness and care for detail.
On either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange had his their glassy dreen mocking off the yellow fields.
One of you would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the devide and that the farmer was a woman , Alexandrabergson.
There is even a white row of pehips in the orchard under the wal nut trees.
Frank Red English spolly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew.

that invitation decided her.
Oh , but I'm glad to got this place mod.
Just smell the wild roses . They are always so spicy after arrain.
We have never had so many of them in a hare before.
I suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them too.
I suppose that's what thecent too , then.

After a few moments , he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swing his sih with that long even stroke that only American boys ever learned
Myri picked up Jherrius and said softly to herself , stripping one glittering ranch after another , shivering when she thought a show r op rain dropps on her neck and hair.
and he made his way slowly down toward the cherry trees.
That summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his men could do that heep up with the corn , the orchard was a neglected wilderness.
I don't know all of them but I know Zar.
If I feel that way , I feel that way.
He reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet incipid fruit , long ivery coloured barries tipped with maint pink like white carrel that fell to the ground unheeded all summer
He dropped a handful into her lap.
Yes don't you.
Oh a much only he seems kind of stay in school .
When she told me about him , I wondered whether she was n't a little in love with him.
It would serve you all right if she walked off with Carl.
I liked to talk to Carl about New York and what a fellow could do there.
oh amiel.
certainly you are not thinking of going off there.
Mariese Bace falls under his brooding gaze.
I am sure hi tats Andra hopes you will stay on here , she murmured.
I don't want to spand around at dawn.
I want to be something on my own account.
Sometimes I don't want to do anything at all and sometimes I want to pull the foure corners of the devide together . He threwhout his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a table cloth.
I got tired of seeing men and horses going up and up undown.
I wish you weren't so rettless and didn't get so worked up over things , she said sadly.
Thank you . he returned quickly
and you never used to be prosse to me.
I can't play with you like a little boy and and more , he said , slowly , That's what you miss Marie.
But maybe if I understand all our good times are over , we can never do nice things together any more.
And how there's nothing to understand.
But but finally it will go away and things will be just as they used to. be be
I pray for you , but that is not the same as if you pray yourself.
I can't pray to have the things I want , he said slowly , and I won't pray not to have them , not if I'm damned for it.
but all our good times are over.
Saturday August fifteen the sea and broke all round no land in sight.
The horizon seemed extremely distant.
My danger and suffering were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him , but now that I am well , nature has resumed its sway.
You seem anxious , my uncle . I said , seeing him continually with his glass to his eyes anxious.
one might be with less reason than now.
I have not complaiting that the rat is slow but that the seat is so wide.
We are losing time and the fact is I have not come all this way to take a little saile upon a pulon on a raft.
He called the sea Apo and I long uwaye took a little sail.
Therefore , don't talk to me about views and prospects.
I take this as my auntswer and I leave to the professor to buite his lips with impatience.
Sunday August Sixteenth.
Nothing know whether the wind freshes.
but there seemed no reason to fear.
The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves.
Truly , the sea is of infinite wit.
It must be as wide as the Mediterranean , are they atlantic and why not.
These thoughts additated me all day in my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours later
I shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance.
I saw at the Hamberg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures , thirty feet long .
I suppose Professor Leadon Brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pig , his eyes focused on the ocean from side to
Twosday August eighteenth.
during his watch I slept.
Two hours afterwards , a terrible shock struck me.
The work was headed up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms.
there's a whale awale cried the professor.
fight was out of the question . Now the reptiles rose , They willed around our little raft with a repidity greater than that of expressed trads.
two monsters only recreating all this commotion and , before my eyes , are rephiles of the primitive world.
I can distinguish the eye of the ictheassourus glowing like a red hot co and his large as a man's head.
Its jaw is normal and , according to naturalists , is arned with no less than one hundred and eighty - two teeth.
Those huge creatures attack each other with the greatest animosity.
Suddenly the icteossourus and the plecius sourus disappear bellow leaving a war poll eddiing in the water.
As for the assourus as he returned to his submarine cabern.
the rowings become last in the distance.
The weather , if we may use the term , will change soon soon
The atmosphere is charged with vapors prvaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters.
The electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dance curn which is dropped over the theatre in which the battle of the elements is about to be waged.
The air is heavy , the sea is calm.
From time through time , a flicy toufh of mise with yet some gleaming light left upon it trop down upon the dence floor of gray and loses itself in the ophag and a peneterable mass.
The atmosphere was evidently charged and something charged with the lecture
The wind always lolled but to acquire increased strength , the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts in rushing storms.
there's a heavy storm coming on , I cried , pointing towards the horizon.
Those clouds seemed as if they were going to crush the sea.
On the mast already I see the light play of a lamin Saint Ar Will'sfire The outstritch saile catches non a breadth of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead.
But if we have now ceased to advance why do we leave that sale loose which at the first shock of a tempest mecapsize us in a moment.
That will be the safe no no never.
The pold of vapors contents in the water and the air puts in the violet action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a wirldwin.
harnsters not.
From the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid life . electric matter is in continual evolution from its component molicules bhe gashes elements of the air need to be slaved with moisture for innermable columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam.
I referred to the thermometer . It indicates the figure is bliteratedg.
is the atmosphere having once reached the stensity to become finel.
the raft bears still to the southeast.
At noon the violence of the storm redoubled.
each of us is lash to some part of the raft.
The waves rise above our heads.
It seems we are lost , but I am not sure .
He nods his consent.
The far ball , half of it wide , half azere blue and the size of a ten inch shell , moved soly about the raft but revolving on its own acess with thestonishing philocity as if whipped round by the force of the worlwind.
Here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast that's it lightly leaps on the provision bag , descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine orrible.
We shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside . It approaches harns who fixes his blue eye upon its sedily It threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it.
A suffocating smell of nigtroted fills the air . It enters the throat it fills the longs.
We suffer stifling pains.
and how odd the directions will look.
poor ouice.
It was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other . He came trotting along and in a great hurry mutdering to himself as he came Oh the duchess the duchess.
Oh what she be servage if I've kept her waiting.
I picked up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept panning herself all the time . She went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today .
and yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've been changed in the night.
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
I shall never get to twenty at that rate.
how cheerfully he seems to grin , how neatly spread is clause is and he welcomes the offiches in with gently smiling jaws.
No , I'd made up my mind about it . If I am miserable I'll stay down here.
It be no use putting their heads down and singing coming up again dear.
I am so very tired of being all alone here.
and I believe it's too bad that it is.
I wish I hadn't cried so much , said Alice as she swum about trying to find her way out.
I shall be punished for it now I suppose by being trowned in my own tears.
That will be a queer thing to be sure.
I am very tired of swimming around here oh mouse.
cried once for this time the mouse was prsling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended.
We won't talk about her any more if we rather not
We want you to help us publish some leading works of luthers for the general American market . Will you do it. ?
The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American streamline him so to speak , because you will never get people , whether in or outside the Lutheran church , actually to read Luther and less we make talk as you would talk to Americans.
Let us begin with his commentary on ongalations.
The undertaking which seemed so attractive when biewed as a literary task proved the most difficult one and at times became a precsive.
It was written in Latin.
The work had to be condensed.
a word should now be said about the origin of Luther's commentary ungulations.
Much later , when a friend of his was preparing an addition of all his latin works , he remarked to his home circle , if I had my way with it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine mygelations fornstance.
In other words , these three men took down the lecures which lutheradressed to their students in the course of galations and roer prepared the manuscript for the printer.
The presents , like no other of Luther's writings , the central thought of Christianity , the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ merits alone.
but the essence of Luther's lectures is there.
The Lord who has given us the power to teach and to hear , let him also give us the power to serve and to do too .
The word of our God shall stand forever.
In every way they sought to undermine the authority of Saint Paul.
They said to the galations you have no right to think highly ofppaul.
He was the last aturned of crist.
polking later in his beneath us.
Indeed , he persecuted the church of Christ for a long time.
Do you suppose God for the sake of a few hundred heretics would emone his entire church.
Against these boasting false apostles , Paul boldly defended his apostolic authority in ministry.
as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person , so the minister of Christ should exult his office in order to gain an uthority among men.
Paltics are proud of their ministry not to their own praise but to the prize of God.
Paul and a postle not of men et cetera.
Either he calls ministers through the agency of men or ecalse them directly as he called the profits an apostles.
pald The clars of the false apostles were called hersent neither by men nor by men .
The most they could claim is that there were simple others.
He mentioned the apostles first because they were appointed direct by God.
The call was not to be taken lightly.
For a person , possessing knowledge is not enough.
is spoils one's best work.
When I was a young man , I thought Paul was making too much of his call.
I did not then realize the importance of the ministry.
I knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught a fistrene set of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting.
This is no sinful pride . It is wholly pride.
in God the father who raised him from the dead.
The classemed superfulous on first sight.
These pervertors of the righesness of Christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both.

By his resurrection , crist won victory over the law , sin , the flesh world , Devil death , hell in every evil.
first two.
and all the breth rooms which are with me.
This should go far and shetting the mouse of the fals apostles.
although the brethrin with me ore not people like me yet , they are all in one mind with me , think right and teach as I do.
They do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate , they go where the cuestions are.
Why did they not invade the Catholic provinces to preach their doctrine to God through princes , bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of God.
We look for that reward which I have not seen nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man.
not all the galations have become prverted.
These means cannot be contaminated.
They remained divine regardless of man 's opinion.
Wherever the means of grac is found , there is a holy church even though anti crise reins there.
so much for the title of the epistole now follows the greeding of the apostlee verse three.
Grace be too you and peace from God the father and from our brother Jhesus Christ.
The terms of grace and peace are common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood.
the greating of the apostles prefreshing.
Grace involves the remission of sins , peace and a happy conscience.
The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.
experience proves this.
However , the grace and pieces of God will.
Men should not speculate about the nature of God.
was it not enough to say from God the Father.
To do so is to lose god altogether , because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and comprehend his infinite majesty.
He came down to earth lifed among men , suffered , was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may be fastened upon him.
embrace him and forget about the nature of God.
He does not crist himself say I am the way in the truth and the life no man comes with a father , but by me.
When you argue about the nature of God apart from the question of justification , you may be as profound as you like.
We are to hear Christ has been appointed by the father as our divined teacher.
At the same time , palkanfirms are creed that Christ is very god.
that crist is very god is apparent in that Paul scribes to him divine powers equally with the father , as for instance , the power to spense grace and peace.
to bestow peacing grace lies in the province of God , who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot.
Otherwise Paul should have written grace from God the father and peace from our brother Jesus Christ.
The Arians took choice for a noble and perfect reacur superior even to the angels because by him , God created heaven and earth.
Mohammad also speaks highly of Christ.
passtixs to his theme.
He never loses sight of the purpose of his essay .
not gold or silver or passial lambs or n angel but himself what four.

underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences.
how may we obtain temission of our sins.
pauliansers the man who is named Jesus Christ and the son of God gave himself for our sinse.
Since Christ was given for our sins , it stands to reason that they calnot be put away by our own efforts.
This sentence also defines our sins as great , so great in fact that the whole world could not make ammends for a single sin.
The greatness of Ransom Christ some god indicates this.
The vicious character of san is brought out by the words he gave himself for r sinse.
but we are careless , we make light of sin.
We think that by some little work or merri we can dismiss ourselves out
This passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold and der sin.
This attitude springs from a false conception of sin , the conception that san is a small matter easily taken care of by good works , that we must present ourselves to God with a good conscience , that we must feel no sin before we may feel that Christ was given for our sense.
This attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others.
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them.
On the other hand , we should not regard them as so terrible that we must despair.
He passes a bruptly from people through ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers the persons from the heavens to men from a stronomy to physiology . He confuses rather does not distinguish the subject into object first and final causes and dreams of historical figures lost in a flios of sense.
But the influence which too , to me , has exercised upon besterity is partly due to a misunderstanding.
In the supposed teths of this dialogue , the neo platinests found hidden meanings and connections with the Jewish and Christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quiet at variante with the spirit of plato.
They were absorbed in his theology and where under the minion of his name , while that which was truly great in truly correct ristic in him , his effort to realize in connect ofstrections was not understood by them at all.
There is no danger of the modern commentators on the temeas falling into the ibbisurdities of the new yo platnests.
In the present day , we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted by himself and by the contemporary history of thought.
The fancies of the neo pladnists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a fase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the Christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own today .
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are supposed to him.
We do not know how much he would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the totrillogis which he has expressly connected was ever present in his mind.
The dialogue is primarily concerned with animal creation , including under this term the heavy bodies and with man as one among the enimals.
but he has not as yet fined this antemediate territory which lies between medicine and methematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in rinking feries of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul.
With heratlitis he acknowledges the perpetual flooks like an excageros He is served the predominance of mine , although he admits an element of necessity which is incapable of subdoing the pifigorians He supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number.
Many , if not all , the elements of the Cretic philosophy are included in the Timeas.
It is sprobable that the relation of the ideis to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times in his life.
The ideas also remained , but they have become types in natural forms of men , animals spurt fish
The style and point of the tomeis tifferd greatly from bad of any other of the Platanic dialogues.
but plato has the same mastery over his instrument which he plays in the fedres or simposium.
Nothing can exceed the beauty or arbe of an introduction in which he uses words after his accustomed manner.
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is holdi given up.
He could ride in one style but not in the other tan . The Greek language had not , as yet , been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena.
Hence we find the same sort of question in the temeos of Plato , which character arizes the philosophical poem of the cricious.
There is an ont of slow and often a defect of ribhen The meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a grater use of epposition in more repetition than occurs in playtols earlier ritings.

But already at e point of economic evolution and the emergence of the lady specialized consemption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a moreol ess celebrite system.
The utality of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivotive growth.
Such consumption as fals by women is mellion siddental to their work . It is a means to their continued labour and not to consemption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life.
With farther advance and culchure this may change into a simple custom of a or less fregrous character , but whatever the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained , whether it be at a bu or a large conventionality , the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.
in the nature of things , lexuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class.
under the taboo called victels and more particularly , certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.
grenkiness and the other pathological consequences of the free ears of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become unerific as being a marke at the second remove of the superior stateus of those who are able to afford the indulgence.
It has even happened that the name for certain disease conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonum for noble or gentle.
The consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master.
with many quofifications with more quolifications as the patriarcal tradition has gradually weakened , the general rute has fallen to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters.
The objection , of course , presents itself is that expenditure on women's dress and household pereprenalia is an obvious exception to this roome but it will appear in the sequel dis ecception is much more obvious and substantial.
The custom of testiv gatherings probably ariginated in motives of friendship and religion . These moatives are also present in the late development , tut they do not continue to be the soul motives.
there is a more alaborate system of ranking grates.
This de frentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequente inheritance of gentlity.
Many of these affiliated gentlemen of lisure are , at the same time , less men of substance in the rown right , so that some of them are scarcely at all sonly partilly to be rated as serious consumers.
Many of them , however , make up the retainer and hangers on of the patrons may be classed as serious consumers without qualification.
many of these again and also many of the others are strucracy of listi grye having turned a toched to the people and more or less comprehensive group of carious consumers in the persons of their wifes and children , their servants retain ers et cetera.
The wearing of uniforms are liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and maveen be said to be amark of servitude real are astensible.
The wearers of uniforms and bodies may be reftly divided into two classes : the free and the servine were the noble and the ignoble.
but the general distinction is not a tatter count to be overlooked.
So those officers which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble , such as government fighting , the care of arms and cutrments and the like . In short , those switches may be classed as sustensibly predatory employment
I never as in these cases , the menial service in question has to deal directly with the primary leisure employment of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected onarific character.
The livery becomes obnoxious to those who are required to wear it.
In a general way , though not tollly nor consistently , these two groups coincide.
The dependent who was first delegated for these stuties was the wife or the chief wife and , as would be expected in the late development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarly performed gradually narrows , the wife remains the last.
But as we descemd the social scale , the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarous leasure in consumption devolve upon the wife alone.
In the communitys of western culture , this point is a present found among the low imiddle class.
If beautiful comfort is achieved and it is more or less portutous circumstance , if they are , it must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves through the great economic law of wasted effort.
The man of the household also does something in these direcion and indeed he commonly does , but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums and presently , the children totally seize to consume valuable goods for apearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household pecuniaritecency.
very much of squallorand discomfort will be indured before the last trink or the last pretence of pecunaritie is put away.
There is no class and no country that yields so obdectly to the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all the gratification of this higher or spiritual need.
The question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the person's whose comvictions it is desired to affect.
Each will serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth.
The mudernerganization of industry works in the same direction , also by another route .
It is evident therefore that the present trend of development is in the diraktion of hihtening the utility of conspicous consumption as compared with leisure.
It is also noticable that the possibility of consumption is a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where human contact with the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest.
consemption has become a larger element in the sander of living in the city than in the country.
among the country 's population its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighboring gossip sufficiently to serve the light general purpose of pecuniary repuit.
The result is a great mability of the labor imploint in printing , perhaps greater than in any other equally well - defined and consetrable work of workmen.
Under the simple test of affectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary communication pretty evenly between the atmosphere outset.
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme . Leisure held first place at the start and came toold rank faramet above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceful culture.
are the circumstances permitting that instinct dispose men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use.
I reconciliation between the two conflict requirements is affected by resort to making believs men and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed . Many organizations have been founded with some various objects of amiliration and bodied in their official styl . There is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the tack is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effect cial economic value of their traffic.
The severe features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated.
Throughout the entire evolution of conspicious expenditure , whether for the good of services or human life , runs the obvious implication that in order to actually mend the consumer's good , it must be an expenditure of superfluities.
As used in the speech of everyday life , the word carries an undertone of depprecation.
The use of wood waste as a technical term therefore impries no deprecation of the motives or of the end' by the constumer under this canon of conspicuous waste.
but it is another ground worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies therprication of what is characterized a suastepull.
In strict accuracy , nothing should be included under the head of conspicious waste , but such expenditure as his encured in the grond of an invitious pecuniary comparison.
and America may be useful in waste both and it's setelited to the consumer and may be made up of use and waste in varying proportions.
And often my mother said while on her lap . I laid my head she feared for time I was not made but for turnity.
Whyare are we denied each other in society.
Why are we divided.
Surely I must be because we're in danger of loving each other too well , of losing sight of the creator and idolotry of the creature.
We used to argue about politics and religion.
She was Torian cleredymen's daughter , was always in a minority of one in her house of violin discent and radicalism.
Her limited health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle.
He spoke French perfectly . I've been told when needed was but I delighted usually talk the greatest Yorkshire.
and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and descenters into which , twenty years ago , the little quiet , resolute clergymen's daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honoured.
January and February of eighteen thirty seven had passed away and still there was no reply from the souvy.
I am not depreciating when I say that in these times it is not rare.
but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you salt your own happiness.
You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution , there can be no peril in it for her.
The more she is engaged in her proper duties , the last leisure will have it even as an accomplishment and a recreation.
to those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity.
But do not suppose that I disparage the gift which you possess nor that I would discourage you from axercising it . I only exhort you to think of it and so to use it as to render it canducive to your own permanent good.
farewel madame.
Though I may be an ungracious advisor , you will allow me to describe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and here after your Tur friend Robert Salthi.
Sir March ixteenth.
I have not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit.
I know the first letter I wrote to you wished all senselhiss trash from beginning to end , but I am not altogether the idle dreaming person it would seem to denote.
I thought it was my duty when I left school to become a governess.
In the evenings , I believe I do think but I never trouble anyone else with my thoughts.
I carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and excentricity which might lead those I live with to suspect the nature of my pursuits.
I don't always succeed , for sometimes when I'm teaching our sowing I would rather be reading and writing , but I try to deny myself and my parents at probation amply reward me for the provation.
Again , I thank you for this incident . I suppose it will be renewed if I live to be an old woman . I shall remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream.
Pies prasser excused me from writing to you for the second time . I could not help writing partly to tell you how thankful I am for your kindness and partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted , However sorffly an ereluctantly it may be at first followed se b.
I cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting these repli.
Keswick marche twenty second eighteen thirty - seven dear Madam
Your letter has given me great pleasure and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so.
In this second letter she also spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if she visited the lakes.
on august twenty seventh eighteen thirty seven she writes.
Come come I'm getting really tired of your absence.
Saturday after Saturday comes around and I have no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then I was told that message coming . Oh dear.
In this monotonous life mind , that was a pleasant event.
I wash ouwer recur again , but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness the instrangement of this long separation will wear away.
My eyes fell tears when I cantrast the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state I now live in uncertain that I ever feel true contrition , wondering in thought indeed longing for holiness which I shall never never obtain , Sometimes times to the heart with the conviction that gasly calvinistic doctrines are true darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death.
If Christian perfection is necessary to selbation I shall never be saved . My heart is a very hot bed for sinful thoughts and when I decide on an action , I scarcely remember to look to my redemer for direction.
And meantime I know the greatness of Jehova . I know the perfection of his words . I adore the purity of the Christian faith . My theory is right , my practice is horribly wrong.
The Christmas holidays came and she and and returned to the parsonage and to that happy home sircle in which alone their natures expanded amongst all other people they shriveled more or less.
Indeed , there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result.
She had gone out into the village on some errand , but as she was descending the steep street her foot slipped on the ice and she fell . It was dark and no one saw her mistake till after a time , her grons attracted the attention of a passor by.
Unfortunately , the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.
However , remembering what you told me , namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision and that you resolved to submit with resognation to that decision , whatever it might be , I hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent and may be all for the best.
After this disappointment , I never dare ruckin with certainty about the enjoyment of a pleasure again . It seems as if some fatality stood between you and me.
I am not good enough for you and you must be kept from the contamination of two intimate society.
A good neighbor of the brontes a clever , intelligent yorkshure woman who keeps a drugis shop in Hawl worth of her occupation . Her experience and excellent sense , she holds the position of village doctress and nurse and , as such , has been a friend in many a time of trial and sickness and death in the households round told me a characteristic little incident connected with tabby's ractured leg.
Tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was , as Charlotte expressed it , one of the family.
He refused at first to listen to the careful advice . It was repugnant to his liberal nature.
This decision was communicated to the girls.
Tabby had tended them in their childhood and nobody else should tend her in her infirmity age.
After the time , they were sad and silent and the meal went away and touched by any of the three.
She had another thing on her mind this Christmas
but Anne had begun to suffer before the holidays and Charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jealous igilance of some wild creature that changes her varied nature if dangeros hreatens her young.
was anxious about this little sister . She upbraded miss DW of her fancies in difference to ansade of health.
Still , her heart had received a shock in the perception of ane's delicacy and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing for exiety which is so full of sedon pings of fear.
I doubt whether Bronwell was maintaining himself at this time.
To celebrate the arrival of her son , Sylvia gave him a splendid supper to which he had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance.
without saying it positively , she made me understand that being herself and a lustrious member of the Republic of Letters , she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect.
In order to please her , I spoke to her about the abbey conti and I had occasion to quote too many lines of that profound writer.
Madame corrected me with a patronising air for my pronunciation of the word scomvra , which means divided , saying that it ought to be pronounced scure and she added that I ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in Paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life.
Her face was in an igma ford in spired every one with the warmest sympathy and yet , if you examined it attentively , there was not one beautiful feature . She could not be called handsome , but no one could have thought her ugly.
Sylvia was the adiration of French and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her , especially of the playse of Marivo , for without her his comedies would never have gone to prosterity.
Sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit , for she knew that she was virtuous only because herself love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters , although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue.
Two years before her death , I saw her berform thet character of Marry Anne in the comedy of Meravox and , in spite of her age and declining health , the allusion was complete.
She was honourably buried in the church of Saint Sovere without the sightest opposition from the venerable priest , who , far from sharing the anti Christian intolerance of the clergy in general , said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good Christian and that the earth was a common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind.
You will forgive me dear reader if I made you tend to the funeral of Sylvia ten years before her death . Believe me , I have no intention of performing the miracle . You may consol yourself with the idea that I shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor Sylvia dies.
I have never had any family.
I had a name I believed in my young days , but I have forgotten it since I have been in service.
I shall call you a spree.
You do me a great honour.
Here go and get me change for a Louis . I have it sir.
at chor service sir.
Madame Quinson besides canenser your inquiries.
I saw a number of chairs for higher at the rate of one man reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees , girls and men breakfasting either alone or in company waiters who were rapidly going up and down and narrow staircase hidden under the foliage.
I sit down at a small table . A waiter comes immediately to inquire about my wishes.
I want to give me some coffee if it is good.
Then , turning towards me , he says that I look like a foreigner and when I say that I am an Italian , E begins to speak to me about the court city of the theatres and , at last , he offers to accompany me everywhere.
I think about him and take my leave.
I address him in a talian and he answers very wittirly but his words make me smile and I tell him why.
My remark pleased him , but I soon proved to him that it was not the right way to speak , however perfect it may have been the language of that ancient writer.
I saw a crowd in one corner of the garden , everybody standing straight on looking up.

That is true bad bad .
All these honest people are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled.
It is sold everywhere , but for the last three weeks nobody used any snuff but it is sold at the Sebet cat.
is it better than anywhere else.
but how did she manage to render it so fashionable.
simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her box filled and by saying to the young girl who handed back the box that her snuff was the very best and paris.
You are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article . In the first case , it receives the welcom of intelligent and talented people and in the second , fools are always ready to reward it for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear sillinness is the daughter of whit.
Let a man run and everybody will run after him . The crowd will not stop , even if the man is proved to be mad , but to prove it is indeed a difficult task because we have a crowd of men who are mad from their birth and still considered wise.
It seems to me I replied that such a proval such ratification of the opinion expressed by the king , the princes of the Blood et cetera is rather approof of the affection felt for them by the nation , for the French carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them in fallible.
When the king comes to Paris , everybody calls out Veeve a Lheroy.
She introduced me to all her guests and gave me some proticulars respecting every one of them.
What Sir I said to him was " I was fortunate to see you.
He himself described the same passage in French and politely pointed out the parts in which he thought that I had improved on the original.
For the first day Sir , I think that what you have done gives us great hope of you and without any doubt you will make rapid progress.
I believe it Sir and that is what I fear . Therefore , the principal object of my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of the friend language.
I am a very unpleasant pupil , always asking questions about curious about troublesome insatial and even supposing that I ca meet with the teacher I require . I am afraid I am not rich enough to help him.

He had a good appetite and good story without laughing and celebrated for his whitty rebbotes and his sociable manners , but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing anyone because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day.
His house keep had the management of everything . She never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave him no account of his money which she kept all together because he never asked her to give him any accounts.
On the sixth of April eighteen thirty , the church of Jesus prist of latterday saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence.
Its origin was small a germ and an insignificant seed hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
Instead of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two squore of adherence , the organization numbers many hundred thousand souls.
In place of a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have comgligated there now are about seventy stakes of zion and about seven hundred organized wards each ward and stake with its full compliment of officers and presed organizations.
The practice of gathering its people into one place prevents the building up and strengthening afford branches and in much as extencive and strong organizations are seldom with broad , very ironeous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church.
Nevertheless , the mustard seed among the smallest of all seats hasitated the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches . The acord is now in oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pogrim journeying its way to truth.
Their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun , not merely that the work of prosletting should be carried on in the west but that the headquarters of the church should be there astablished.
The book A Mormon had taught people the true horrigon and destiny of the American Indians and toward this dark skined remnant of a once mighty people , the missionaries of Mormonism turned their eyes and with their eyes wint their hearts and their hopes.
It is notable that the Indian tribes have carely regarded their religion of the latter day saints with favour , seeing in the book a Mormon striking agreement with his own traditions.
The first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of Curtlind , Ohio , almost within sight of the lake eerie It here soon rose the first temple of modern times.
To the fervent latter saint , a temple is not simply a church building and house for religious assembly.
Soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased homes and Missouri was dependent on Jackson County being their center , but from first they were unpopular among Missourians.
The lieutenant governor , Little Bentabu Bogs Afterward governor , was a pronounced mormon hater and throughout the period of the troubles he manifested sympathy with the persecutors.
Their sufferings have never yet been fitly cronicled by a human scribe.
Making their way across the river , bhost of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of Claycounty and afterward istablished themselves called Well County . They indownting the city of far West.
A small settlement had been destroyed by Mormon families on Shol creek and here on the thirtieth of October , eighteen thirty - eight accompanies of two hundred and forty fellupon the hapless settlers and butcherd a score.
beit said to the honour of some of the officers trusted with a terrible commission that when they learned its true significance they resigned their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold - blooded butchery.
Oh what a record to read what a picture and how awful the fact. was
American school boys read with emotions of horror of the albirgenzes driven beaten and killed with a pepa leggate directing the butchery and nofthe thog dwa hunted and howded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree and they shall read the history of their own country of science as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate.
who began the quarrel was the Mormons.
As the sable of the press comments against the brutality of the missourians I quote apparagraphs from the quincy arguss march sixteen eighteen thirty nine.
It will be observed that organized mobs aided by many of the civil and military officers of Missouri with governor 's bogs on their heads have been the prominent actors in this business incited two , it appears against them , Mormon political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge.
The army found that people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth.
but a word further concerning the expedition in general.
It was through Floyd ad Vice who who ordered the military expedition to Utah austensibly to install certain federal officials and two repressed and alleged infantil rebellions which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interests of these escessionists.
Moreover , people are inclined to rebellion while geatter opportunities they wished.
Already Endorth and South were talked of someone who set up in the west.
They knew no north , no south and east or west . They were soot positively by the constitution and would have nothing to do with the bloody stripe between brothers ' unlestened deed . They were sommoned by the authority which they had already once loyelly responded to furnishing men and arms for the countri's need.
What the letter tay says is less than marriage is characteristic of the church and is in very general practice , but in solesto marriage , plurality of wives was an incident , never an essential.
We believe it a literal resurrection in an actual hereafter in which future states shall be recognized every sinctified an authorized relationship existing here on earth between parent and child , brother and sister , husband and wife.
It has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one and yet to find the place and meet the people where with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among the meligned moremons in the mountain valleys of the west.
At the inception of porol marriage among the latterday saints , there was no law national or state against its practice.
In eighteen sixty - two , a law was inacted with the purpose of suppressing woreld marriage and , as had been predicted in the national senate priyor to its passage at Lay Tor , many years had died
Federal judges and United States hattorneys and newtap who were not Mormons nor lovers of marmonism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its lack of justice and inadequacy.
This means that Foran illeged mister meanor for which Congress prescribed a maximum pedalty of six months on prisoment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be in prison for life for many terms of a person 's natural life until the court's power to enforce its sentences extens so far and might be fined millions of dollars.
Therefore , this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and they met with the reversal and rebukeat deserved being prisoned under sentence of many years .
The people contessed these measures one by one in the courts , presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure.
Then the church was disincorporated and its property was real and personal confisicated and was shiated to the government of the United States and , although the personal property was soon restored , real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the court receivers and the modern church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property.
and so the story of Mormonism runs on its fanali has not yet been written . The current press presents continuously new stages of its progress , new developments of its plan.
mainhole like Dalexander because he was an engineer.
We had freqoncied ideas about everything and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers and mechanics.

He was beginning to feel a keen interest in the slender bearefoot dawnky girl who slipped in and out of the play singing like someone winding through a hilly field.
One night , when he and his wife were sitting together on the bridge , he told her the things that had happened while he was studying abroad , but he was sorry about one thing in particular , and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them.
She considered her moment in mensaid No I think not that way . I'm glad you asked me.
After that , it was easy to forget actually to forget.
Of course , he reflected , she always had that combination of something horridly ind sensible and something utterly wild and deaft.
She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to.
I'm glad she's held around sense.
After all , we were awfully cold
She shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it now.

They asked him to come to see them and clean them and they spoke very tenderly of Helda.

When Bartley arrived at Betford Square on Sunday evening , the pretty little French girl methim the door and took him upstairs.
I should never have asked you if Smalli had been here because I remember you don't like English cuisine .
I haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is.
They are all sketches made of the villadesta you see.
Their friends are all very loyal , even in the main hall.
I've managed to save something every year and that with helping my three sisters now and then and tiding poor cousin Michael during bad seasons.

Her hair is still like flac and er blue eyes or just like a baby and she has the same three freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to her banda Maire.
How jolly it was being young helda.
Do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris.
Come we'll have her coffee in any other room and you can smoke.
I think we did , she answered merily.
What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our friends but just young
They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money God give you a happy love.
The strange woman and her passionate sentences that rang out so sharply had frightened them both.
Bartley started when held around a little bell beside her dear me , why did you do that.
It was very jolly , he murmured lasily as Marie came in to take away the coffee.
have I told you about my new play.
When she finished , Alexander shook himself out of a reveree.
nonsense . Of course , I can't relyse sing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me.
It's really too warm in the srom to sing , don't you feel it.
Alexander went over and opened the window for her.
there just in front.
He stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it soft and misty , see how weird the stars are.
For a long time , Bartley spoke.
He felt a tremmor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him.
bartly leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear " you are giving me a chance yes.
Alexander clunched two hands at his sides.
The stop in Queen's town , the tedious passage of the mercy were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
She blushed in smiled and fonbled his card in her confusion before she ran up downstairs .
Alexander pased up and down the hallway , buttening and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to his living room.
The room was empty when he entered.
Alexander did not sit down.
I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something beautiful was going to turn up.
I thought it might be sister Kater 's Cousin Mike happening along.
She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth , her knees drawn up to her chin , laughing like a happy little girl.
When did you come to layer and how did it happen ? You have n't spoken a word.
I got in about ten minutes ago.
Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
bartly bent down over the fire.
She looked at his heavy shoulders and bigged determined head brusted forward like a catapulein lash.
I'll do anything you wish me too , Bartley said tremelously.
I can't stand seeing you miserable.
He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
hill to watch him from the corner , trembling and scarcely breathing , dark shadows growing around her eyes
but it's worse now it's unbearable.
I get nothing but misery out of it .
The world is all there just as it used to be but I can't get at it any more.
It was myself I was defying helda.
Her face quivered , but she whispered . I think it must have been.
but why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer.
Alexander groaned . I meant to , but somehow I couldn't.
She pressed his hand gently and gratitude.
made you happy at all.
She closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
He moved on easily and his chair creeked.
Yes yes , she hurried , pulling her hand gently away from his
Please tell me one thing Bartley . At least tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy.
Yes , I know that , he said simply.
I understand Bartley was wrong.
but I didn't know you have only to tell me now.
What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often I come , no matter how hard I work .
keep away a few wishes when I ever follow you.
Aexander rose and shook himself angrily . Yes I know I'm chowardly.
He took her roughly in his arms . Do you know what I mean.
What should Bartley do.
I will ask the least imaginable , but I must have something.
I must know about you.
The sight of you bartly to seeing you living and happy and successful can never make you understand what that means to me.
You see , loving someone is something I love . You made the whole world different.
and then you came back not caring very much , but it made no difference.
He bent over and took her in his arms , kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes.
I don't cry , don't cry , he whispered.

It was quite true that a vessel was insight hardly more than six miles from the shore , but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision , the rigging of the top mass alone was visible above the water.
exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope.
She is undersaile but she is Count Timishef's yacht . He was right.
If the count were on board , a strange fatality would bring him into the presence of his rival.

The wind being adverse , the dobrena did not make very rapid progress , but as the weather , in spite of a few clouds , remained calm and the sea was quite smooth , she was enabled to hold the steady course.
servadack took it for granted that the dogrina was endeavoring to put in.
A narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the rougfest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters.

nothing more than you know yourself.
Are you certain that this is the Mediterranean.
For some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied and then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions.
to all these inquiries , the count responded in the affirmative.
Some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements.
You will take me on board , will you ?
my yard is at your service Sir even should you require to make a tour around the world.
The count shook his head.
Before starting , it was indispensible , but the engine of the dugrena should be repaired to saile under canvus only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult.
It was on the last ey of January that the repairs to the schooner were completed.
a slight dimmunution may eccessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things , but whether this was to be attributed to any alterration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide.
Doubts now arose and some discussion followed about whether or not it was desirable for bensoof to accompany his master.
Her seagoing qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
After an opprenticeship on a merchant ship , he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant , and the mecount appointed him to charge of his own private yacht on which he was accustomed to spending a greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters.
The late estounding events , however , had rendered the procope manifastly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety.

Another circumstance was most remarkable.
To the surprise of all and especially of the lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth o from for five fathoms and although the sounding was persevered continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area , the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in the emmy degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terrassed like the seats of an empatheatre.
You must see Lieutenant , I should think that we are not as near the coast of Algeria as you imagined.
After pondering a while , he said , if we were farther away I should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fabhoms five fathoms.
Its depth remained variable at four or at most five fathoms and although it'ssssss bottom was siduously dredged it was only to prove it was bearon of marine production of any type.
Nothing was to be done but to put about and return and disappointment toward the north.

She succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight showne in so brightly that she could distinguish the color of some damask hanging in the room.
She saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed like that of a prince than that of a private gentleman.
Among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucific of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window.
This person was ridiculous , though he had gone to look for his friends , he had changed his mind in that respect , not thinking it advisable to acquaint them but what had passed between him and the girl.
On the contrary , he resolved to tell them that he was repenting of his violence and , moved by a tear , he had only carried her halfway towards his house and then let her go.
choking with e motionlocadia made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them.
That would be very well , my child replied to her father , if your plan would not lieable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning . I have no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner and he would have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there.
What you should best do my child is to keep it and pray to it that sins were a witness to your undoing , it will daign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment.
Thus did the humane and right - minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother , embracing her again , did all she could to sooth the feelings.
She , meanwhile , passed her life with her parents in the strictest to retirement , never letting herself be seen but shunning every eyelisted should read her misfortune on her face.
Time rolled on and the hour of her delivery arrived . It took place in the upbost secrecy and the mother taking upon her the office of midwife as she gave birth to a son , one of the most beautiful ever seen.
When the boy walked through the streets , blessings were showered upon him by all who saw him , blessing upon his beauty on the mother who bore him and the father that begat him upon those who brought him so well.
One day , when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation , he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horseman.
The bed she too well remembered was there and all the cabinets on which had stood the image ye had taken away were still in the same spot.
Lowis was out of danger in a fortnight and a month he rose from his bed and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child.
Thus saying , ampressing the crucifix to her breast , she fell fainting into the arms of Danna Issafania , who was a gentle woman to whose six pityes a natural cruelty as the man instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl , shetting over her so many tears that their needed no other sprinkling of water to recover the ocadia from her soon.
I have quit things to tell you Sinor said Dornlas ta fangye to her husband lo criam and the substance of which is that the fainting girl before you is your daughter and the boy is your grandson.
This truth which I have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we have both beheld that of our son.
Just then , Locatea came to herself and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears and the gentleman remained in artebe wilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end the whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimones.
So persuasive were her intreaties and so strong resurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information . She thought they were induced to confess that one summer's night she had mentioned themselves and another friend being out on a stroll with redolful they had been concerned in the adoption of a girl whom he dolfol carried off whilst the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could.
For god's sake , my lady mother give me a wife who would be a guaranteed companion not one who will discuss me so that we may both bur evenly and with mutual good will to marry ar mas by heaven and sad of pulling this way and that way and fretting each other to death.
Her bearing was graceful and animated . She led her son by the hand and before she walked to maides with wax slights and silver cantle sticks.
al rose to do her reverence as if something from heaven had meraculously appeared before them , but gazing on her and trance with admiration , not one of them was able to say a single word to her.
She reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever , and racked by the intensity of her emotions , he suddenly changed color , her head dropped and she fell forward in ta swoon into the arms of the dismaye ast to fania.
His mother had left her to him to be her destine protector and when she saw that he too was insensible , she was teacher making a third and would have done so had he not come to himself.
No then son of my heart that this fainting lady is your usual brigde . I say real because she is the one whom your father and I have chosen for you and the portrait was supretence.
Just at the moment when the tears of the piting beholders flowed fastest and their ere jaculations where the most expressive of despair , locatia gov signs of recovery and brought back gladness to the hearts of everyone
When she came to her senses and blushing to find herself and wod olf as arms would have disengaged herself nor sidneura he said that she must not strive not to withdraw from the arms of him who holds you in his soul.
This was done because the event taking place at a time with the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of marriage without any of the prliminary formalities which are now so properly required.
nor was he less surprised than they were and he was to assure himself or so wonderful a fact he begged the localia to give him some token which should make perfectly clear to him that which indeed he did not doubt since it was authenticated by his parents.
You know Captain Lake.
said Lord Shelford , addressing me.
He had his hand on the lake 's shoulder.
their cousins . You know we are all cousins.
Whatever Lord Chelford said , Miss Brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile.
but her greeting to captain Leake was more than usual , haughty and frozen and her features looked particularly proud and pale.
Dinner was easy and fun .
I'm glad you would like it , says the wirelder chuckling bheningnantly over his shoulder.
I believe I have a little taste that way they are all real . You know those jewels.
and he pleased it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little paralela gram with a gleam of sly amusement.
I was thinking it's very like the aparts answered the captain softly , smiling on.
Whereupon the lake laghed quietly , still looking at the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
and wiled her lefed two more suddenly and noisily the huor of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes unlake but the gallat captain did not seem to accept it and , after a few seconds more , he handed it very innocently thack to missus darthy only remarking.
to you know Lape Oh I really can't tell , but he'll soon tire of country life.
He's not a man for country quarters.
I had a horrid dream about him last night .
Oh I know that's born brandon.
All the time he was talking to me , angry little eyes were following him
Miss Lake declined the carriage to night.
and he added something still less complimentary.
but don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly.
In the meantime , I had formed a new idea of her.
By this time , Chelfard amalder returned , and disgusted with myself , I ruminated on my want of generalship.
and he made a little dip of his cane towards the branded hall over his shoulder.
He asked , so they said but that would I think have been worse.
The old fellow's been a little bit wild . He beonds a bovet once.
He is a very good fellow , I can assure you. he
I don't know when , can't say how you find gentlemen to find wickedness only as an obscure female . I speak according to my light and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this country .
While you know rady women like wicked fellows it is contrast , I suppose , but they do and I'm sure from what Bract has said to me , I know him intimately , that Dorcis likes him and I can't cenceive why they are not married.
There we continued silent for the greater part . Neither was quite satisfied with the other , but Rachel at last said.
Now that's impossible for I really don't think I once thought of him all the sevening except just talking.
There was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging bowhs and witheredleaves and the modl bites and shadows glided oddly across his palefeatures.
don't insult me stanley by talking again as you did this morning.
When I say is altogether on your own account.
Mark my words you find him too strong for you and two deep.
I 'm very uneasy about it , However it is , I can't help it.
To my mind , there is always something inexpressibly awful in family fus.
The mystery of their origin , their capacity for evolving leden faculties of crime and the stedy bytality with which they survive the herse and speak their deep mouth middlinitees in every new generation have associatd them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and e special say tack action.
The floor , more than anything else , showed the great age of the room.
My bad was unexpected , belid comfortable , but in my vhen mood I could have wished it was a great deal more modern.
The curntins were thick and feet ed tapistry.
all the frniture belonged to other times.
I shan't trouble you with my train of thoughts or fancies , but I began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story watching experimentally in a haunted chaberer.
I did not even take the pecaution of smoking up the chimney.
I bullblelighted my TE route.
A cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows.
The sumber old trees like jigantic herse pluomes black and awful.
Somehow I had grown nervous.
A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly.
It was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of Redmont's farm.
while she was better , though she had had a bad night.
so there came a step and a little rustling of feminin dreeperies The small door opened and Rachel entered with her hand extended and a pail smile of golcam.
Women can hide their pain better than men and bar it better too , except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice.
but poor Rachel Lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which ennables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile.
This transit spring and lighting up are beautiful a glambour beguidling our senses.
There was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was nutery chol and comforting and she returned the very kindly and felt more like her former self.
Rachel's pale and sharpend features and dance struck her with a painful surprise.
He was so bad , my poor rechel.
ill and trouble dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous.
poor rechel heard nature recoiled from deceit and she told at least as much of the truth as she could
She spoke with a sudden energy which partook fear and passion and flushed her cheek and made her languid eyes flash.
Thank you Rachel , my cousin Rachel , my only friend.
Chelford had a note from Mister Walder this morning , another note his coming delayed and something of his having seen some person who was abroad continued dorkess after a little pause.
Yes something , everything said Rachel hearredly looking frowndingly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers.
Yes said rachel.
and the oracl having spoken , she sat down in the same sort of obstraction again beside Dorkus and she looked full into her cousin's eyes.
of Mark Wilder I say his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this , you will never ask me to speak again about him.
It is an antipathy and intipathy I can not get over dear dorguess . You may think it madness , but don't blame me.
I have very few to love me now and I thought you might love me as I have begun to love you.
and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and breeveery chol , at last , burst into tears.
dorguess in her strange way was moved.
I like you Rachel . I'm sure I'll always like you.
You resemble me Rachel . You are fearless and inflexible and generous.
Yes Rachel I do love you.
Thank you darkastear.
He began a confused complaint against the wizard who advantished behind the curtain on the left.
give not so earnest mind to bese mummories child.
a golden fortune and a happy life.
He was like my father in a way and yet he was not my father.
Also , there was a stripling page who turned it to a maid.
This was so sweetily desir and in some ways I do think she died.
but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came.
Sister Nol do you hear these marvels.
take your place and let us ye what the crystal can show to you.
like not young , though I am an old man.
forth with all rant the opening of the tent to see what might be missing , but the master will who peeped out first needed no more than one glance.
He gave way to the others very readily and retreated unperceived by the squire in Mistress Fitzzuth to the rear of the tet.
cries of unnotting ham a' not accaim.
before they fled the stroller and his three sons were caplas and terrified.
what is the tumult and righeting cried out the squire athoritatively and he blue twice on the silver whistle which hung on his belt.
nay we frused their request most politely , most to the little stroller.
and then they became vexed and would have nashed their purse for us.
I could not see my boy injured excellence for but doing his duty as one of McDonald 's sons.
So I did push this fellow.
It is enough , said George sharply as he turned upon the crowd.
She must ouse to that cry and I blushed for my fellow and not incam.
shurtly we can submit with good grace.
to his fine for you to talk to an old man , answer the lean sullin a prentice.
But I restled with this fellow and do know that he played on fairly in the second bout.
spoke to the squire loosing all patients and it was to you that I gave another person consolation.
Come to me men here here He raised his voice louder.
The strollers took their part with hardyzasse now that they had some chance of beating off their foes.
robit in the little tumplwer between them tried to force the squire to stand back and very valeanly to these two comport themselves.
The head chief of the riot in Nodtingham with clenched fists threatened Monty Sha.
The squire helped him thrust the all in and entered swiftly himself.
He may be silent or life has begun , but the captured prentice set up an instant chance .
silence unive cried monfiche.
He felt for and found the whiserd's black cloth . The squire was quite out of breath.
thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent , the robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout.
a moffiche a mot be shae game well to the rescue.
Taking advantage of these thesquires you men doubled their efforts and were incouraged by robins and the little strollers crying further waigyt to themselves
George Montfe Sha will never forget this day.
What is your name ? " asked the little stroller recently
ropind fits roth.
and mind shall become rats.
right willingly for between us we have won the battle answered robin.
I'd like you . You are the second person that I have been interested in in two days . Is there a sign of that.
After , she called out for the robin to give him an arm.
friends said montfy sha fantly to the restlers bear us escorts so far as the sheriffs house.
It will not be safe for you to stay here now.
pray follow us with mind ind my lord Char iffs men.
Not ag him , the castle was reached and idmittent was demanded.
Master Monseu , the sheriff of nodding , was mightily put about when told of the rioting.
and Henry might return to England at any moment.
have your own child if the boy also wants it must , Shay answered , feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then.
He made an effort to hide his condition from them all and Robin felt his fingers tightend upon his arm.
beg me a room of the sheriff child quickly.
but who was this fellow ? Plucky was speeve.
He is my excellency returned Robin from ticnity.
Mistress Fitzoth had been carried off by the sheriffes daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house , so that Brouh alone had the care of Molti She.
Robin was glad when at last they were left to their own devices.
The wind certainly brought back the colourd to the squire's cheeks.
These escapates are not for old games well , his day has come to twilight.
Will you forgive me now.
it will be nodisappointment to me.
no thanks , I am glad to give you such easy happiness.
you are a worthy leat will presently whisper crobind the wine is a marvel.
I will show you some pretty tricks.
young fits ooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire.
Therel fell in an anxious interview , Mistress Fitterth arguing for and against the squire's project in the breath.
must all robins think of their father and what he would counsel. him
If you are a woman you are yourself , I cannot stay with you.
but take it will live and where monfy shes shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so briave a sight for you will narror disgrace our stuch and I warrant myself
the lad answered him then.
Never that Sir , he had said.
He was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm.
Now to bed boy.
It was late and I got myself in a short time .
dismiss your squire robin and bidme good yen.
as any in Angland would say , said Kenewell proudly , that was in his day.
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning come.
There was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to well's room .
precently he crossed the floor of his room with a decided step.
will cried softly and stuttly who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's room and sprang up at once an answer.
We will go out together to the bower . There is a way down to the cort from my window.
rest and be still until a warns you.
the hours passed wearily by and movement could still be heard in the hall.
Finally , all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell.
will whispered Robin , opening his door as he spoke , " are you ready. ?
They then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs.
robin entered the hot dragging the unwilling esquire after him.
Be not so foolish , friend said fittuoth crossly.
They moved there after cautiously about the hut , groping before and about them to find something to show that the warranted an idfulfilled mission.
There was upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and I stuttly tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit.
fittuths hand rested at last upon the top rumn of a ladter and slowly the truth came to him.
robin carefully descended the latter and found himself soon upon firm brocky ground.
studtly was by his side in a flash and then they both began feeling about them to as certain of the shape and character of this mistake .
from the blackness behind the light , they heard a voice warrantons.
save me master's but you startled me rarely.
cried , he waving the lanthern before him to make sure that there were no ghosts in front of him.
inquired robin with his suspicion still upon him.
Truly , such a horse would be worth a and n't fair.
day and lording antered morrinton with a half laugh.
Warrant and spoke thus with significance to show rob that he did not think Jeffrey's claim to the estate would be passed by.
Robind fitsoth saw that his doubts of terms had been onfair and he became ashamed of himself for harporing them.
His tones rang pleasantly with onwarrantans ears and fourth with the good fellowship was haralded between them.
The old servant told him quietly as they crept back to Gaimwill at this passage led from the hut in the pleasants to Shurwood and that Jeffrey , for the time , was hiding with the outlaws in the forest.
He implores us to be disgreet as the grave in this matter , for in sooth his life as in the hollow of our hands.
They regain their apartment , apparently without disturbing the household of
out in the woods stood a nice little fur tree.
The place he had was a very good one . The sun shown on him as fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large - sized comrade pines as well as trees .
He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air . He did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
but this was what the tree could not bear to hear.
In winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground , a hair would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree.
Oh that made him so angry.
to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that , after all , is the most lightful thing in the world.
In autumn the wood cutters always come and felled some of the largest trees.
This happened every year and the young furtry that had now grown to a very satisfactory size trembled at the sight of the magnificent great trees falling to the earth with noise and cracking . The branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and believe they were hardly to be recognized and then they were ladin carts and the horses dragged othem out of the wood.
have you not met the many were.
rejoice in your growth said the sunbeams.
and then what happens then.
I would fay no if I was destined for so glorious a career , cried the tree rejoicing.
I am now tall in my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year . Oh.
were but old ready on the cart.
were I in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence.
Yes and something better , something still grandler will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ortament me.
Something better , something still grander must follow , but what.
brechoice in the presence of the air and the sunlight.
rejoice in my own fresh youth.
but the tree did not rejoice at all . He grew and grew and was green both winter and summer.
and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down.
The axe struck deep into the very pith . The tree fell to the earth . With a sigh , he felt a pang as like a swoon . He could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up.
He well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades , the little bushes and flowers around him any more , perhaps not even the birds.
but departure was not at all agreeable.
The trie olly came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid . We don't want the others.
There , too , were large easy chairs silken sophas , large tables full of picture books and full of toys with hundreds and hundreds of crowns and then the children had so.
The servants as well as the young ladies decorated it.
this evening they all said.
how it will shine this season
Perhaps the other trees from the forest have come to booket me.
it blazed up famously help help.
cri the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire.
a story.
a story where the children draw a little fat man towards the tree.
but I shall tell only one story.
There was not filled downstairs and yet he married the princess.
That's the way of the world.
thought the first attempt and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well.
I won't tremble when morning thought of the fur tree.
and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought.
In the morning , the servants and the housemaide came in.
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here there was a dark corner where no daylight could enter . They left him. behind
What's the meaning of this title the tree.
and he leaned against the wall , lost in revery.
time enough had two for his reflections for days and night's passed on and nobody came up and when it lasts everybody did camt . It was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way.
It is now winter outdoors through the tree.
how kind a man is , after all.
If it were not so dark here and so terribly lonely.
sweak squick.
They snuffed about the trees and rustled among the branches.
I am by no means old , said Tree.
there's many ones considerably older than I am.
They were so extremely curious.
I know no such place , said the tree.
and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said.
said the fur tree , thinking over what he had himself related.
Yes henriality those were happy times.
po he is hopy dumpy asked the mice.
only that one answered the tree.
It is a very stupid story.
Don't you know one about Bican and talo candles ? Can't you tell any lonely stories.
No said the tree.
Then goodbye to the rats and they went home .
Finally , the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all . It was very pleasant when the sleek little mie sat round me and listened to what I told them.
Now that two is over.
Why One morning there came a couple of people and they set to work in the loft.
The trunks were moved , the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard . It was down on the floor , but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone.
but it was not the tir tree that they meant.
It was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles.
The golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine.
In the court yard some of the married children were playing who had danced a Christmas around the tur tree and were so glad at the sight of him.
and the gardener chopped the tree into small pieces . There was a whole heap lying there.
The wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and its side so teeply.
However , it was over . Now the tree was gone , the story had an end.
to it , ten brothers refram from delling the other girls or Uncle John of old would rogers visit , but they got Mister Watton in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forty ocheck.
It was a serious crime . Mister Watson told them and Tom gates was fair to serve a lengthy term in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash act.
I gan't see it in that light said the old lowyer.
It was a deliberate teft from his employer's to protect a girl he loved.
but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats to resting her were probably mere bluff.
He was harded in impetuous beth and being in love , he was stout enough to count the cost.
If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forge check , then the young man would be allowed freedom.
but under the circumstances , the idea of such an arangement could be made.
Fairview was twelve miles away , but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county drail.
They were eceived in the little office by a man named Markhum who was the jailer.
We wished to talk with him , " Kenneth said
I'm reading for representative on the republican ticket said Kennoth quietly.
i'l say that's different observed markum alter is dimmeter.
Maybe see gates at once Aske keleth.
They followed the jailer along the route of passages.
Sometimes I yearn infer smoking is nearly crazy and don't know which is worse one way or the other .
He arnocked the door and called Here's visitors Tom.
worse than worse en error replied the chailer glomily.
Mister Graff said , Kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the white from the passage fell upon it.
There is an oreception room in the jail. We
se town please say gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice . There's a penchere.
The fresh , wholesome looking boy was Tom Gates with steady gray eyes , an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth.
We have heard something of your story from Kenneth and our interested in it.
I didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not . I did it and I'm glad I did it.
hold well as a fine fellow who was poor and helpless since Missus Rogers had her accident.
Then roders would do anything but stay around and wait for her and the place went to rocken ruin.
He spoke simply but pasted up and down the narrow sell in front of them.
Whose name did she sign the check ? asked Kenneth.
He is supposed to sign all the checks for the concert.
it's a stock company in Rich.
I was bit keeper , so it was easy to get a blink check and forged the signature.
As regards my robbing the company , I'll say that I saved him a heavy loss one day.
I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plent but the marshall never even thinke me.
It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling tent to know the truth.
I'm going to see Mister Marshall , said Kendeth and discover what I can do to help him . Thank you Sir.
I won't be much but I 'm grateful to have found a friend.
They left him then for the jailor arive to lock the door and take them to the office.
I've seen lots of those kinds in my day.
and it runes a ands jisposition.
He looked up rather ungraciousleep but motioned them to be seated.
Some girl has come in here twice to interview my man and I have refused to admitter.
I'm not electioneering just now.
Oh well sir what about him.
and he desserves a term and states prison.
It is cos me twice sixty dollars in annoyance.
I'll pay all the conpesides.
You foolish . Why should you do all this.
I have my own reasons , Mister Marshall.
Give me a check for a hundred and fifty and I 'll turnd over to you the forge check and qash further proceedings.
ha dedtested the grasping despisiouson that would endeavour to take advantage of his evident desire to help the gates.
bet's uneasy at a silence nudged him.
There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrood face.
He might have had that forge ceck for the face of it if he'd been sharp.
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars.
So , to the surprise of the democratic committee and also friends , Mister Hopkins announced that he would oppose the FORCS aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars on doing so as might be necessary.
One of Fister Hopkins ' first tasks , after calling his faithful hinchmen around him , was to make a careful canvase of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished.
The weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from opposition.
The democratic committee figured out how to do this.
Under ordinary conditions , renolds was sure to be elected , but the committee proposed sacrificing him in order to ele copkins.
The only need was to fix the renalds and this was arranged personally.
and this was why kenneth and brother discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
The description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both waughing hartily over things when the young people passed them and thus Mister Hopkins failed to notice who the occupant of the other vehicle was
These women were fluttered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing Fister Forbes.
They hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were listed.
The fair view pant was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guess.
Tables were spread on the lawn and a dance and substantial repass was to be served.
This was the first occasion in a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elherst and the only place within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests.
The attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted to see great success in their fight.
We ought to pay more attention , said Louise , approaching her cousin.
won't you run into the house and see if Martha can't spare one or two more maids.
She was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt Jane was their mistress here and they were her special favourite.s
The housekeeper led the way and others followed.
For a moment , betstood stared while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face.
She was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at Elm , a black gown with a white baprint and cap.
Then she gave a little out and required no miss being Melizabeth Parsons.
but it can't be protested by the girl.
I attend to the household mending you know and care for the limen.
I speak like an educated person saying , wondering where your home. is is
For the first time , the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
She sat down on a rock chair and clasping her hands in her lap , rocking slowly back and forth . I'm sorry , said beth.
Alye a parsmons shook her head.
Fate They excite me in some way and I can't bear them . You must excuse me.
She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.
She was a beautiful girl , the most handsome of the three cousins by far , yet Alizea surpast her with natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact.
Her manter was neither independent nor assertive , but rather one of well - prepared composure and calm reliance.
her eyes wandered to the maid's hands.
However , her features and face might repress any evidence of nervousness . These hands told a different story.
She rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catcher breath.
I wish I knew myself , she cried fiercely.
Will you leave me alone in my own room or must I go away to escape you.
Aliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and the key clicked in the lock.

The English foated to the French baskets of flowers of which they had made a plantable trovision to greep the arrival of the young princess . The French , in return , invited the English to a sepper which was to be given the next day.
cangradulations were poured upon the princess everywhere during her journey.
from the respect she her on all sides , she seemed like a clean and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three , she appeared like an object of worship . The clean mother gave the French the most affectionate reception . French was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget friends.
She taught her daughter then by her own affection for it , that love for a country where they had both been hispitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them.
The count had thrown himself back on his sea leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus , his face buried in his hands with a heaving chest and restless limbs.
This has indeed been a harassing day , continued the young man , his eyes fixed upon his friend.
You will be frank with me . I always have
Can you imagine how Buckingham has been so finelent I think
It is you hermis taken Rau . I have read the distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the day.
I can perceive love clearly enough.
I am convinced of what I said to the count.
It is an annoyance then.
In those very terms I even hadd more.
But the continued raul was not interupted by this moment of his friend . Heaven be praise the French who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet , reckless , even capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bearow matters of such high importants.
Thus it is that the honor of three issaved are the country 's master's and our own.
Yes , I need to repose many things that have agitated me all day both in mind and body . When you return to Morrow , I shall no longer be the same man.
In this friendly pressure rowked detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict.
The night was clear , bright and splendid . The tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored peace and security everywhere.

I have made another discovery.
There was certainly no near solution to their problem.
The poor little things cried Synthia thinking of them having been turned to the wall these years.
Now what is the sent of two innocent babies like that.
but joyce had not been listening all at once , she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion.
The twin brother did something she liked and she turned his picture on the wall.
Hers happened to be in the same frame too , but she evidently cared about it.
Now what have you to say sinpias brog.
I thought we were stumped again when I first saw that picture , but it appeared to some uwse after all.
Do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing.
which in the world is the clear choice.
Maybe it makes me terribly depressed and I like to see what this lovely fureniture looks like without such quantities of desk del over its scheme
You come in here in the afternoon with old clothes on and half a regular house cleaming.
He can't hurt anything . I'm sure we won't disturb things at all.
This thought , however , did not enter the heads of the inthusiastic pair.
Smuggling the house claiming parfenelia inside the cellar window on that afternoon proved no easy task for Synthia had added a wisk brol and dust pan to the outfit.
The leer provfed too much , so nobody came to look after it as friskly as a young kitten , much to her as delight when she caught sight of him.
Oh let him come along . She urged me to love to see him about that old house.
He makes it sort of cosier.
fell dust on the furniture and pictures.
Yet little as it was , it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room.
surfaces had at least been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish.
thena she suddenly asked
and my pocket money is getting low again and you haven't any left as usual.
They say alumination by candle is the prettiest in the world.
here o go my seeusual They both cried peering in.
whos behind the greatest forgivting into odd corners.
Forgetting all their weariness , they seize their candles and sturry through the house finding an occasional paper tucked away in an odd corner.
Well , I am confused by the board and up house mystery that happened not earlier than April sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later.
No words were spoken , no language was uttered saved on of waling in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and nodd en reality.
I heard a noise behind me . I turned and saw the caffer 's black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife . He lifted it above his head as if to strike , but he had the strength of ten men and I hurled him from me.
onward said a distant voice.
no sound broke the stillness of the knight.
The story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition I wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said.
What was that.
What then a human hand , large and shapely , appears distinctly on the surface of the pond.
Nothing more , not even the rist to which it might be attached.
It did not beckin or indeed move at all . It was as still as the hand of death.
I woke to consciousness fighting . At first , it seemed as if I was fighting with a fantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me . It was catfere.
The sound of voices and the flash of light.
a feeling of freedom and I was awake somewhere
said another voice which I recognized I found Tars Casher.
I had barely known what I had been saying or doing up to this time , but as he spoke I looked at my hand.
In the light of the moon , I saw a knife rad with blood and my hand too was also discolored.
I do not know I am dazed and bewildered.
but that is a caffer's knife.
I know he had a very nice evening.
I remember saying , have we been brought ?
But chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it.
I say you do know what this means and you must tell us.
A terrible thought flashed into my mind.
I had again been acting under the influence of this man's power.
perchance too caffer's death might serve him in good stead.
my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech laughed me.
My position was terrible.
my over brought nerves yielded to last.
For some time after that , I remembered nothing tistinctly.
The three modes of management.
to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
my reason and affection.
As the chase drives away , Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep , her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor destrust and suspicion of her mother 's disappointment , vexation and ill humour strange and swell among those delegate organizations in which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury.
the mother , as soon as the chase is so far turned that she can no longer watch the expression of her continuous ghoes away from the door with a smile of complasency and senisfaction on her face at the engenuity and uccess of her little partifice.
So you will be a good girl I know and not make any trouble , but you will stay at home contentedly won't you.
The mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection.
If you should not be a good girl , what should be signs of causing us any trouble ? I 'll have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone.
but this last upposition is almost always unnecessary , for if Mary had been actually managed on this principle , she would not have caused any trouble.
It is indeed true that the importance of technique and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated.
To such people , these interacting modes of training children inhabits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are especially useful.
Della had a young sister named Maria and a cousin whose name was Jane.
Now gellia cantrive to obtain a great influence and a cendency over the minds of children by means of these dolls.
to guarantee idea of these conversations , I will report one of them in full.
You have come and Della and Dela was the name of Jeane's dance to make a visit.
I am very glad.
I expect you have been a very good girl and Ella since you were here last.
Then turning to Jane she asked , in a somewhat altered tone , Has she been a good girl Jane.
For instance , one day the children had been playing in the piazza with blocks and other play things and finally went into the house , leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done.
They were now playing with their dolls in the parlour.
deli came to the parlour and with an air of great mystery teckened the children aside and set them on a wisper leave and Della and stayed there and did n't say a word to them.
So saying she led the way on tipto , followed by the children out of the room and round by a sircutous root to the piazza there.
said , pointing to the blue things see.
put these plea things all away quickly and carefully and we will not let them know anything about your leaving them out.
and this method of treating the case was much more effective in making them dispose to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been.

That is comparatively nothing.
They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing.
Without going to any such extremists , we can easily see unreflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresse upon the mind.
The pain produced by an apt of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away , but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
but wonder cared nothing about that.
He made abou so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumbfounded . I can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders.
He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jacknife.
Now this knife was a splendid one , though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and wonder new that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jacknife.
Yes , why not ? thought answer
Seeing that I am so fine , I may as well go and visit the King.
I am coming to the courtball , answered answer
and she took his hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and through the matnificent halls where courtiers in silk and vilvet stood bowing wherever they went.
four like is not . They must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
At the farther end of the largest hall , a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rose.
on huge silverplatters wore pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering cantors.
The princess sat down under a blue canopy with boquazse roses and she let ander sit in a golden chair by her side.
but you must eat with your cap on your head , she said and was going to take it off.
The princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her , but with the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
He only shook his head.
Well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chaine around his neck and thent down and kissed him.
That is a very fine cap you have , he said.
So it is Sen Anders.
and it is made of mothers best yarn and she mittet at herself and everybody else to get it away from me.
with one jump anders gets out of his chair.
He darted like an arrow through all the halls , down all the stairs and across the yard.
He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown , he said that anders was stupid.
Ander face grew red.
but his mother hugged him close.
No my little son , she said.
If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe , you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap.
At the conclusion of the banquet , which was served at forty o'clock , the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated custume representing spring , which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornoment workers of the court.
Ah very well.
Lat am came in , then asked the king and , as if Colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself away from the conversation , he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two cuartiees.
juttleman to your posts were upon Saint Anyan and Feleroigh took their leave.
certainly sir , but I must have money to do that too
What do you mean ? " asked Louise.
He has given them with too much grac nut to have others still to give if they are required , which is the case at the present moment.
It is necessary therefore that he should comply , the king frowned.
does your imajesty then no longer believe that disloyal attempt.
not at all . You are , on the contrary , most degreeable to me.
Your majesty planned this affair .
You will take them from my private treasure.
The news circulated with the repidity of lightning . During its progress it cendled every variety of cocatry desire and weird ambition.
The king had completed his toilet . By nine o'clock , he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers.
The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent daas or platform located upon the borders of the lake . It was a theatre of wonderful elegance construction.
Suddenly , for the purpose of restoring peace in order , spraing accompanied by his whole court made his appearance.
The seasons of spring followed him closely to form a quadreal which , after many words of more or less flattering import , was the commencement of the nands.
His legs , the best shaped on court , were displayed to great advantage in flesh - colored silk and hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself.
There was something in his carriage which resembled the boyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to be alone
Yes it is suppressed.
Far from its sire your majesty has given no directions about it . Their musicians have retained im.
yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet.
Sire he said , " your majesties most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle.
The king seemed only pleased with everyone present.
The monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.
the balley began , the effect was more than beautiful.
When the music with its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers , when the simple untutered pandemime of the period only the more natural on account of the very different acting of the august actors had reached its commonating point of triumph , the theatre shook with tummultuous pleasure
disdainful of a success of which Madame showed no acknowledgement , he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess.
by degree , all his happiness , all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power , his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied.
The king , who had from that moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadreal cast a luok upon his vanquished rival.
Everyone one could observe his agitation and prostration opprestration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to seeing him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side , his head bewildered and as his eyes witholl their bright intelligence demed.
Upon this , Madame Daine turned her eyes languishingly towards the comt observing.
Do you think so ? she replied with indifference.
Yes , the character which your royal highness assumed is imperfect harmony with your own.
explain yourself.
I allude to the Goddess.
the princess inquired no.
She then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
A quarter of an hour afterwards , he returned to the theatre , but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for level is thus strangely constituted he found that it impossible even to remain much longer supparated from their presence of one who had broken his heart.
When she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself.
I am pleased the evening is most lovely.
indeed a.
I remember now and I congratulate myself do you love any one.
Forgive me . I hardly know what I am saying a thousand times . Forgive me , Madam was right . quite right , This brutal exile has completely turned my brain.
There cannot be a doubt he received ukindly for in fact you returned without his permission.
all Madmaselle why have I notded voted sister or a true friend such as yourself.
Well , already here , they said to her.
I have been here for quarter of an hour , replied labadier.
Did not the dancing amuse you ?
no more than dancing.
Le Vallier is quite a poetus said Tonysharant.
I am a woman and there are few like me whoever love me , flatters me , whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well , said Montale , you do not finish.
It is too difficult , replied Mudmoiselle Detani Shalan , laughing loudly.
Lucky under do you not see the moon slowly rising sivering the most branches of the chestnuts and the oaks.
exquisite soft turf of the woods The happiness which your friendship confers upon me.
well said madmoiselle detenechalant . I also think it is a good deal , but I will be careful .
to say nothing , said Montalet , so that when Mudmoiselle deternicharaunt thinks Nay is the only one who knows it.
quick quick then among the high reading girls said Montalet stoop at the na You are so tall.
The young girls had indeed made themselves small indeed visible.
She was here just now , said the count.
you are positive then.
Yes , perhaps I frightened her and what way.
how is it Levalier said Madmoiselle detenishant that the vicompd o Bregalone spoke of you as Louise.
It seems the king will not consent to it.
God gracious has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind.
I give my consent.
Oh , I am speaking seriously , replied Montale and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the kings . I suppose is not louise.
but we ran then said all three and , gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses , they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covert of the park.
In fact , the sound of madames and the queen's carriages could be heard and the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers.
In this way , the fed of the whole court was also for the mysterious anhabitants of the forest . For certainly , the deer and the broken pheasant on the branch the fox in its hole were all listening.
All about him was a tumult of bright and broken colour scattered on broad plashes.
The mergancer had a crested head of ears designed dark black , a broad collar of dark white , black back , black and white wings , white belly sides finely penciled and black and white and a breast of rich chestnot red streeked with black.
His feet were red , his long narrow beak with its sal tooth edges and sharp hoped tip was bright red.
but here he was at a terrible disadvantage , as compared with the owls , halks and eagles , he had no rending calls.
but suddenly streiet and swift does a diev in cormerant he shot down into the torent and disappeared beneath the surface.
Once fairly awing however , he wheeled and made back hurdly to his perch.
and might have seemed that a trout of that size was a fairly substantial meal.
but such was his keenness that even while the wide fluks of his engored dovictim were still sticking out of the corners of his beak , his fierce red eyes were once more ppearing downward into the torent and sarch of fresh prey.
In the theater he hurled himself downward too soon.
The great hock foued huridly to etrieve his prey from the ground.
The cat growled softly , vicked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
In fact , he had just minished the last of the trout's tale , had just finished with a spasm down his straind gallet when the baffled hock caught sight of him and swooped.
The howk lit on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised.
like his unfortunate little cousin the Teal , he had felt the fear of death mitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the howk should not discern him.
The howk sat upon the branch and watched his quarrys swimming bneath the surface.
Almost instantly , he was forced to the top.
straight in the hock lidted from his hair and darted after him.
but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down.
but this frequent term , the heights of air , for all his savage valor , he was troubled by the leaping waves in the tossing foam of these mad rapids . He did not understand them.
as he flew his way down , reaching utching talent were not happy to above the fugitives ' head.
where the wavs for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach.
But as before , the leaping waves of the brapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his way onward in the cloud of foam old doom hung low above his head , yet he hesitated to strike.
The hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a worker not to be shaken off or vaded or deceived.
He had a lot of lin out and the place was none too free for a long cast , but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was sfeeding.
The last dropp fly as lucky have it caught just in the corner of the hock , angrily opening beak , hooking itself firmly.
at the sudden sharp sting of the great bird , he turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank.
The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling.
then the leader parted from the line.

That summer immigration , however , being mainly from the free states , greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties.
For general service , therefore requiring no special effort , the nuclear merical strength of the factions was about equal one . On extra ordinary occasions , the two thousand border off in reserve lying a little farther back from the state line told it any time easily turned the scale.
The free state men had only their convictions , their intelligence , their courage and the moral support of the north . The conspiracy was a secret combination of the territoryal fficials the legislature , the vogus laws , the courts , the militia officers , the president and the army.
This was a formable array of advantages slavery was playing with loaded dice.

Several hundred free state men promptly responded to the summons.

To embarrass this damaging exposure , judge lacamp issued a red against the ex governor on a frivolous charge of contempt.
The incident was not biolent nor even dramatic . No possy was summoned , No further effort was made and the reader , fearing personal violence , soon fled in disguise.

After a few days , an officer came with a recuisition from Governor Shannon and took the prisoner by land in west port and afterwards , from there to Cansa city and Lebanworth.
Here he was placed in the custody of Captain Martin of the kickapho rangers , who proved a kind jailer and materially assisted in protecting him from the dangerous intentions of the mob which at that time held leaven worth under the rain of terror.
Captain Martin said , I shall give you a pistol to help protect yourself if worse comes to worst.
In the early morning of the next day may twenty nine , a company of dragdons with one empty saddle came down from the fort and while the pro slavery man was still sleeping , the prisoner and his escort were on their way across the prairies to Tecompton in the charge of officers of the united states army.
He was thrown into prison for this enterprise and detained for some time . He was not discouraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to infuse spirit into the distressed rialists.
Among other persons of distinction who ounited themselves to him was Lord Napior of Merchaston Sun , the famous inventor of the loggeretms the person to whom the title of a great man is more justly due than to any other whom his country ever produced.
Well , the former said that the Scottish peminenters were secretly forming a union with the English parliament and incalcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking . The latter still sisted that every such tempt would precipitate them into intermeasures to which otherwise they would not perhaps in cline.
The kings ' ears were now open to Montrose's counsels , who proposed none but the boldest and most daring , agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in Scotland.
Five hundred men who had been levied by the covernanters where persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combind force he hastened to attack Lord Elco who laid it perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the Irish invasion.
Dreading the superior power of ourgile who having joined his vassels to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army , Montrose hastened northward in order to rouse again the Marquie of Huntly and the Gordens who , having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the comenenters.
This nobleman's character , though celebrated for political courage and conduct , was very low for military prowess and , after some scirmishes in which he was worsted he allowed Montras to escape him.
By quick marches through these inaccessible mountains , that general freed himself from the superior forces of the cominenters.
With these and some reinforcements from the ethol men and McDonalds whom he had recalled , montrase fell suddenly upon our guile country and let looce upon it all the rage of war , carrying off the cattle , burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword.
This suverity by which Montrose sullied his victories was the result of private and emosity against the chieftaon as much as of zeal for the public cause . Our guil of three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at in a locky supposing himself still at her considerable distance from them.
by a quick and unexpected march on tros hastened to Inelocky and presented himself in order of battle before the suprised but not frightened covernantes.
his conduct and presence of mind in this emergance appeared conspicuous.
mantrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horses with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to the road fell with united force upon their feet who were intirely cut in pieces though with the loss of the gallant lord Gordon on the part of the royalists.
from the same men knew regiments and new companies were formed , Different officers were appointed and the whole military force was put into such hands as independence could rely on.
Besides members of parliament who were excluded , many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals through their commissions wearily cilitated the project of putting the army severely into the hands of that faction.
They said the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible . A more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders.
Valor indeed was very generally deffused by one party as well as the other . During this period , discipline was also attained by the forces of the parliament , but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seemed still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting.
Historians , at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience , have not remarked on anything but a head long impetuous conduct , each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determined the success.
He passed through Henley Sint Albans and came so near to London as Harrow on the hill.
The Scottish generals and commissioners were affected to great surprise by the appearance of the king and , though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity , they instantly set a bare upon him under colour of protection and made him in reality be a prisoner.
They informed the English parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king.

The good natured audience , Piti to fell in majesty showed a greater defference to the king than to the minister and sung the salm which the former had called for.
The parliament and discots laid their proposals before the king.
Before the settlement turns , the administration must be possessed intirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king is easily imagined.
the English it is evident that had they not been previously assured of receiving the king they would never have parted with such considerable support and wuile they weakened themselves by the same measure , they have strengthened the people with whom they must afterwards have so much material interest in discuss.
If any still retained rancer against him in his present condition , they passed in silence while his well wishes more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with hatclamations and with prayers for his safety.
His death in this conjuncture was a public misfortune.
The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise.
What is called perception differs from sinsation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associated images and expectations of their usual coreletes all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation.
Whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions , everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth , though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that I das proximately represent impressions.
and what sort of evidence is logically possible.
There is no logical impossibility in the hygh pothesis that the world spring into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past.
All that I am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember.
The person who attempts to make psychology arecord of behavior has to trust his memory and make the record.
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times . If the behaviorist is confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit , that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times.
but I do not think such an ifference is warranted.
Our confidence or lack of competence in the accuracy of a memory image must , in fundamental cases , be based upon a characteristic of the image itself . Therefore , we cannot avoke the past easily and compare it with the present image.
We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which we do not trust . For example , under the influence of fatigue we may see a French face vividly and clearly but horibly distorted.
Some images , like some sensations , are very familiar while others look strange.
familiarity is a filling capable of degrees.
In an image of a well known face , for example , some parts may feel more familiar than others . When this happens , we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts.
I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past.
They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.
In actual fact , there are doubtless various factors that can cur and give us the filling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event.
There may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pastness , especially where immediate memory is concerned.
There is , of course , a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of fiellings giving their temperal relation to the present , but it is clear that such fillings must play a serious part in the process of dating remembered future
If we had retained the subject or acted in knowledge , the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple.
Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered.
Some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
And in this case , as in most others , what may be taken a certain in advance is rather vague.
The first of our vague but intubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
We might provisionally , perhaps not quite correctly , define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue and our knowledge of the future . Such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned , though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy.
This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory.
A grammaphone by the help of seuitable records relates to the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramiphones as they like to believe.
I can set to work now remembering things I never remembered before , such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be a holiday habit that enables me to do this.
The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.
semmons to books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all .
They give waws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images referr to past occurrences , which is what constitutes knowledge memory.
It is this that is a venturost to the theory of knowledge.
It is by no means always reliable . Almost everybody has at some time experienced the well - known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.
Whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object , it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object , which leads us to the judgment this is familiar.
Thus , no knowledge of the past can be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
A further stage is recognition.
direcognition and this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of a sociation the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.
We are , of course , able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen before , but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible for animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition of this first sence of the word.
This knowledge is memory in one sense , though in another it is not.
There are , however , several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with . It might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as I have seen this before than as it has existed before.
The definition of my experience is difficult . Broadly speaking , it is everything that is related to what I am experiencing now by certainlangks of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.
Thus , if I recognize the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it forms part of my experience , by definition , the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single oubt from the rest of the world.
Of course , the words that have existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition , but that is unavoidable . Words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means positive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as it recognition.
I stayed there alone for many hours , but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.
Had Cress Weller not been good looking , had Jack Ban still in college , had Sir Kennyton Obal remained in Angland , had Mister Bunnet and the barkeeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill , should I have succeeded in rating for the final departure of my old friend.
On arriving at home and my own home , I found that our room was filled with a brilliant company.
As I spoke , I made him a gracious bow and I think I showed him by my mote of address that I did not bear any grudge as to my individual self.
I have come to your Mister President with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this Disney quarter of the world.
We have our little shruggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rosewater.
We are quite satisfied now , Captain Battle Ax said to my wife.
quite satisfied , said eva.
the ladies and compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic or on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other.
No doubt the process of time the ladies will follow.
Their masters said Missus never bend.
I did not mean say captan battllax tho touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this.
Missus never been You should be proud of your son.
Jack was standing in the fourth corner of the room talking to Eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises.
Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player , said my wife.
My wife and son and the two cress wellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next.
This I felt was paid to me as being president of the Republic and I endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit for the occasion , but I could not notice that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life.
My wife , on the spuro the moment , managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner.
This , she said , was true hospitality and I am not sure that I did not agree with it .
then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were , for the most part , the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.
Oh yes , said Jack and I'm nowhere.
but I mean to have my innings before long.
of what Missus never went through and providing birds , beasts and fishes , not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day . No one but myself could have any idea , but it must be admitted that she accomplishe her task with thorough success.
We sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then ashore.
How much evil and real accomplished evil has not occurred to me during the last few days.
What can I do now but just lay myself down and die.
and the death of which I dream could not dream
When this captain should have taken himself and the vessel back to England , I would retire to a small form which I possessed at the far side of the island and there in seclusion would I end my days.
Jack would become a happy husband and would remain amist the hurried duties of the eager world.
thinking of all this , I went to sleep.
Mister never bend began the captain and I observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president . It cannot be said that we have come here on an unpleasant mission.
You have received us with all that courtesy in hospitality for which your character and England stand so high.
It is a duty , said I.
but your power is so superior to any that I can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yield to it.
Not a doubt , but had your force been only double or trouble our own , I should have found it my duty to struggle with you.
That is all quite true . Mister never been said Sir Ferdmand Obran.
I can afford to smile because I am absolutely parilous before you , but I do not feel that in the progress of the world is concerned or rather we have been put down by brute force.
You have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction.
Therefore , I feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a kourtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally.
I can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since I have been on bor.
Then he said sirferd nando there was nothing for it but that we must take you with him.
There came upon me a sudden shock when I heard these words which exceeded anything which I had yet felt.
you hear what Sir Mand o Brown has said , replied Captain Battle Ax.
but what is the delicate mission asked.
I was to be taken away to Carriageto , England or elsewhere or drown upon the voyage and it mattered not which
Then the republic of British Yula was to be declared as non existent and the British flag was to be exalted and a British governor and stalled an executive chambers.

One of us always remains onpoard while the other is on sure.
What worldwide inniquity such a speech as that thescloseves sad I still turn myself to the captain for though I would have crushed them both if my words had been possible , my dislike sentured itself unsirferd mando.
You will allow me to suggest that him , but that is a matter of opinion.
If I were to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion , I would seem to have done so willingly
The letter ran as follows.
Sir , I haven't incommand to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called Britain Yula.
The procurlar circumstances of the colony are within your excellence's knowledge.
But in their selection of a constitution , the British uless have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprong their present difficulties.
It is found in the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work.
but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor.
The John Brik is armed with a weapon of Greek power against which it is impossible that the people of Britain Yulo should prevail.
You will carry out with you one hundred men of the north northwest Burmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if a mister never withdraws the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience.
When do you intend John Bright to start.
Today I shauted.
and I have no one ready to whom I can give up the archies of the government.
I shall be happy to take charge of them , said Sirfern Ando.
They , of course , must all be auter.
or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible.
Your paret is sufficient , I said.
If you will give us your promise to meet captim adlax here at this time in the morning , we will stretch a point and delay the departure of John Bright for twenty - four hours.
and this plan was adopted too , in order to ebxtract from me a promise that I would depart in peace.
This was what dared the misthiv so far as the running away was concerned.

Three seconds before the arrival of Jb Hobson's letter , I know more dream of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage.

As soon as they entered the room of the great Nife , the booloroo gave a yellow disappointment.

The captain shook his head.
Why are you sitting ton fetching the first living pretur we met and that was this pilling oat ? " replied the captain , panting hard as he held vast to one of the goat worns.
The idea of patching cap'n buill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter.
They look something alike , you know , suggested the captain of the guards , looking for one to the other doubtfully and they were nearly the same size of a high stande boat on their high legs . They both got the same style of whiskers and they were both obstinate and dangerous , so they ought to make a good put landed.
fine porious.
When this had been accomplished , the boolaro leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before.
At once , the goat gave a leap to escape from the soldiers and , with a bowed head , rushed upon the booloroo.
Before any good stop him , he butted his majesty so furiously that the king 's sword farine into the air and tumbled in a hape among the benches where he lay money and growing
The goats looked like spirits were roused by the successful attack.
Then they sperin great haste for the door and the go gave a final but that sent the row of royal nadies all diving into the corridor in another tangle , whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified every one within the sound of their voices.

What will be such satisfaction.
The guard had a terrible struggle with the goat which was looseen the room and still wanted to fight , but finally they subdued the animal and brought They took the bulloroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both ham and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room ot the palace.

Fell is like a watry bow and like a parting cloud , like a reflection in a glass , like shadows in the water , like dreams of infants , like a smile upon an infant 's face.
wike the duve's voys like transient days like music in the air ah.
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of him that walket in the guarden in the evening time.
The lily of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered the lovely maiden said I am a watcery weed and I am very small and I love to dwell in lowly vails so weak the gilded butterfly scarce purches on my head , yet I am visited by heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the balley and each mourn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou newborne bluoly flower.
thou gentle maide of silent valleys and of modest brooks , for thou shall be clothed in the light and fed with morning mana till summer heat mounts thee beside the fountains and the springs te flourish in aternal veiles They Why should they complain.
Why should the mistress of the veils of Har answer asig.
She seased and smiled and teares then sat down in her silver shrine.
which thou dust scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milk cow andtams the fire - breathing steed.
but thou him like a faint cloun kindled by the rising sun , I vanished from my pearly throne and who shall find my place.
and why it scatters its bright beauty through the humid air.
descend a little cloud and hovfer before the eyes of fell.
o little Cloud the virgin said , I charge le to tell me why thou complaines now When in one hour thou away , then we shall seek me but not fine . Ah fell is like to Thee.
I pass away yet I complain and no one hears my voice.
The cloud then showed his golden head and his bright formemurge.
and feierce thou because I fanish and be seen no more.
It is a ten - fold life til love to peace and ractures holely unseen descending way my light wings upon bomy flowers and courts the fair eye to take me to her shining tent , the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen son.
till we arise linked in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all the tender flowers.
live not alone nor of himself . Fear not and I will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice.
come forth worm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen.
The helpless warm rose sat upon the lilyes leaf and the bright cloud sailed on defined his partner in the veil.
image of weakness art thou but a worm.
I see they lay helpless ing maket weeping and non to answer none to cherish thee with mother's smiles.
and say thou mother of my children , I have loved thee and I have given her a crown that none can take away.
and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot.
or an eye of gifts and graces showering fruits and cointed goals
Why is a tongue impressed with honey from every wind.
Why in ear a whirld pool fierce to draw creations in.
all is said without a word.
I sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy islads from an unaverd yet pronicle inward joy.
I did not wrong myself , but I placed a wrong on myself .
When called before , I tell how hastily I dropped my flowers or broke off from a game.
showiy never miss hometolk and blessing and the common kiss the cons to each turn nor count it strange when I look up to drop on a new set of walls and floors another home than this.
Alas , I have grieved , so I am heard to love.
Open thy heart wide and fold within the wet wings of the idove.
good it means to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow.
nay I was rather thrilled , distrusting every light that seemed to gilte onward path and feare to overlean a finger even.
and though I have grown serene and strong since then , I think that God has willed a still renewable fear.
oh love oh troth.
and love be false.
If he was to keep one oath , he must lose one joy but his life's star for Tole.
slow to the world greeding quickly with its light when the angel speak.
a ring of amethist I could not wear here more to my sight than that first kiss.
That was the crism of love which loves own crown.
Dearest teach me so to pour outgratitude as thou dust good.
musclemens and guyords throw curchefs with a smile and half no ruth for any weeping.
but thou art not such a lover my beloved.
thou can't wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think about it soon when others cry too late.
I think all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine.
Oh to shoot my soul's full meaning into the future that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endurers from life that disappears.
Then I long tried by natural ills , received comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrim staff gave out green bleas with morning doomed impearal.
I love thee freely as men strive for right . I loved people purely as they turned from prays.
I loved thee with the passion put to yuse in my old grees and with my childhood's faith.
I loved them with a love . Ie seemed to lose with my lost saints . I loved thee with the breath smile teared of all my life and if God toose I shall but love better after death .
