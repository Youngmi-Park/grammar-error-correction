A cold loocid indifference reigned in his soul.
The chaos in which his ardor extinguished itself was a cold , indifferent knowledge of himself.

On Saturday mornings , when the so dality met in the chapel to recite the little office , his place was a cushioned neeling desk on the right side of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the responses.
Her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity , her holiness . A strange light blowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her.
If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her night.

But as the dusk deepening in the school room covered his thoughts , the bell rang.

Stephen , leaning back and drawing idly on his scribler , listened to the talk about him , which he checked from time to time by saying.
It was strange that he found an arrid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel more deeply his own condemnation.
The sentence of saint , which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all , had seemed to him first a swoll and phrase until he had begun to grop in the darkness of his own state.
If a man had stold on a pound in his youth and had used that pound to a mass a huge fortune , how much he was obliged to bogive back the pound he had stolen . Only was the pound , together with the compound interest in crewing upon it or all his huge fortune.

Why was the sacrament of the ucharest instituted under the two species of bread and wine if Jhesus Christ presented body and blood , soul and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone.

A gentle kick from the tall boy on the bench behind urged Stevhen to ask a difficult question.
The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from.
He clasped his hands on the desk and said.
The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour of ofsaint Francis Zavier , whose feast day is Saturday.
On Friday , confessions will be heard all afternoon after beads.
Beware of making that mistake.
Stephens ' heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flour.

The rector paused and then shook his claspd hands before him went on.

In the silence , their dark fire cindled the dusk into a tawny glow.
He could wait no longer.
For a full hour he had pacted up and down waiting but he could wait no longer.
He set off abruptly for the bull , walking rapidly , lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe.

Pride after satisfaction lifted him like long slow waves.
Their feet are like the feet of hearts and underneath the everlasting arms.
The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding.
The unknown faces passed him by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and , as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference , a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face.
andry with himself , he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge , but he still saw the reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humbled tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes , brother Hicki.
Brother and brother Khiov.
Their piety would be like their names , like their faces , like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble land , contrite hearts might be paid far more tribute to devotion than his had ever been a gift , ten fold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration.
It was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates , stripped of his pride , beaten and inbeggars weeds , that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves.
idle and imbittering , finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as himself with the same kind of love.
The phrase and the day and the scene harmonized in accord.

You will find me continually speaking of formen tision hole bine turner and tin cutet with almost the same terms.
the united every qualities and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorests , sometimes as kirus scuruss.
By being studious of color , they are studious of division , and , while the curoscurest devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing - unseparated light , the colorests have for their function the attainment of beauty by rangement of the divisions of light.
My first principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of lang portions of distinct hues side by side.
Some of the touches indeed when the tenteras are mixed with water have been laid in little drops and pands so that the pigment might crystalize hard at the edge.

The brown ground beneath his left , for the most part , one touch of black as put for the hollow to delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandable.
For believe me , the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock is robbed in this to be read and a bagrass plot to be green and the best skill fart is instantly seizing on the manofold deliciousness of light which you can only seeise by precision of instintaneous touch.
Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonizes with the other hues , it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds and the round window will tell as jeels if they are gradated justly.
but in these various cappit from the turner , you have the two principles brought out perfectly.
They are beyond all other works than I know , existing dependent on their effect on mountains of subdued tones . Their favourite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper.

do not therefore think that the gothic schools are an easy one.ss
The law of that school is that everything should be seen clearly or at least , only in such faintness as shall be delightful and I have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground.
This at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative , that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that , in fact , your producing jewelers work rather than pictures.
That astyle is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also a runius.
In all whole gothic art , indeed , you will find failure of this kind , especially distortion and regidity , which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid ropose of classic art.
The large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that are merely children ish in failing work of an inferior hand . It is not characteristic of gothic or any other school.
But observe you can only do this on one condition that striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination.
It will be really impossible for you to retain the tranquility of temperant felicity of faith necessary from noble private painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and pece of practical life.

Nothing will be more precious to you . I think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way , OLL things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter.
You know , I've just been telling you how the school materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire.
Here 's an equally typical Greek school landscape by Wilson Lost wholy and golden Nest , the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees were towers and no care for color whatsoever , the perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist of pollo and the pifhon.
Now here is raug fial exactly between the two trees , still drawn leaf by leaf holly formal with beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance.
While then finally , here is the Greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the development of it with cloud and fire.
only there are two sorts of clouds far.
He knows them both.
There's one and there's another , the dudly and the flint.

It was this observation that was true from Douglas then , but later in the evening , reply that had an interesting consequence to which I called attention.
Someone else told a story not particularly affective which I saw he was not following.

let me say here distinctly to have done with that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what I shall presently give.
Poar dogbess before his death when it was in sighe committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that , in the same spot with immense effect , he began to read to our hushe to the little circle of the night of the fourth
The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course , thank heaven stay . They departed in consequence of arrangements made in a range of curiosity as they promised produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up.
The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had a manner of gun.
He had for his own town residence of a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase , but it was to his country home and old family place in essex that he wished immediately to proceed.
The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relationship and that his own affairs took all the time.
There were plenty of people to help , but , of course , the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority.
I don't anticipate.
She was young . I'm tried to be nervous . It was a vision of serious duties in a little company because of really great loneliness.
hehs but that's just the beauty of her passion.
It was the beauty of it.
The sound of a dull that sounded strange and all the reasons because of his main condition
She promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when , for a moment delighted , he held her hand , thanking her for the sacrifice , she already felt rewarded.
but it was all her reward which of the ladies asked.
How strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the groth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that throwh its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child.
God , as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished , had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parents for ever with the race and descent of morals and to be finely a blessed soul in heaven.
yet these thoughts affected hester prin less with hope than apprehension.
The child had a native grace which does not embariably coexist with faultless beauty . It's a tire , however simple , it always impresse the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best.
This outward newt ability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life.
Hester took only account of the child's character and , even then , most vagally end imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while the pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from the material earth.
There were now alluminated by the morning radionce of a young child's disposition , but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whor awind.
Hester , nevertheless , the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of trying on the side of undue soverity.
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes , she sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant and mortality that was committed to her charge.
As to any other kind of discipline , whether address to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach , in contrast with the kaprice that rolled the moment.
It was a look so intelligent yet incredibly perverse , sometimes so malicious but generally accompanyed by a wild flow of spirits that the teacher could not have questioned at such moments whether a pearl was a human child.
Beholding it haster was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elph in the flight which she envariably began to snatch her to her bosom with close pressure and earnest kisses , not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that the pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive.
brooding over all these matters , the mother felt like wone who has a voke to spirit , but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence.
Parl was a born outcast of the inventile world.
Parl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance.
After speaking to her , she would not speak again.
Hester print went one day to the mansion of the governor belling ham with a pair of bloves which she had frnged and emboidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state , though the chances of a popular election had caused the sformer ruler to descend a step for two from the highest rank he still held and honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy.
Another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves inpelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the suttlement.
In that epic of pristine simplicity , however , matters of even lower public interest and a long less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state.
The period was hardly at all earlier than that of our story , when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature.
We have spoken of pearl's rich and luxurious beauty , a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints , a bright complexion , eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in recent years would be nearly akin to black.
It was the scarlet letter in another form , the scarlet letter in dowled with life.
The mother herself as if the red ignomine were so deeply scorched andto her brain that all her conceptions of its form had carefully wrought out the similitude , lavishing many hours of morbid genuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture.
But in truth , for all was one as well as the other and the only inconsequence of that identity had haster contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance.
come therefore and let us sling mud at them.
But perl , who was a dauntless child after frowning , stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures , suddenly made a rush at the not of her enemies and put them all to flight.
She screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them.
It was further decorated with strange and seemingly capolistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when laid on and had now grown hard and doorable for the admiration of after times.
They approached the door , which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projecton of the adofice in both of which were latis windows with wooden shutters to close over them at needed .
Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal , Hester police gave a summons which was answered by one of the governors ' bond servants , a free - born English man but now a seven - year slave.

With many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials , the diversity of climate and different modes of social life , Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of Faras state in his native land.

little pearl , who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontous piece of the house , spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate.
Mother cried . She I see you here look look.
and the truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it.
fearl accordingly , ran to the bowindow at the further end of the hall and looked along the viste of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and invetor attempt at shrubery.
but the proprietor appeared already to have reelinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence , the native English taste for ornamental gardening.
There were a few rose bushes , however , a number of apple trees , probably the descendents of those planted by the reverend Mister Blackstone , the first settler of the penincula that half - historical character who rides through our early annals seaded on the back of a ball.
Pearl seing the rose bushes began to cry for our red roses and would not be passified.
He wore blue silk stockings with blue nee pans with gold buckles , a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braded with gold.
His hat had a peaked crown in a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved.
Instead of shoes , the old man wore boots with turnover tops and a blue coat that had wide cuffs of gold braid.
For a long time , he had wished to explore the beautiful and of os in which they lived.
When they were outside , Ung simply laphed the door and started up the path.
No one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone.
At the foot of the mountain that separates the country of the monchkins from the country of the Gillickans , the path divided.
He knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was his nearest neighbour.
All the morning , they trudged up the mountain path and Adnoon Unk and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket.
Then they started on again and two hours later came the sight of the house of the doctor pipped.
all conocted the door of the house and a chubby , pleasant - faced woman dressed in Lin blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile.
I am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home.
We have come from a lontlely place than this place.
and you must be ojo the unlucky , she added.
Oh Jo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life.
Where travelling replies , Ojo and Les stoff your house just to rest and werefresh ourselves.
The woman seemed thoughtful.
At one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row , all bubbling in steaming at a great rate.
It takes me several years to make this magic powder , but at this moment I am pleased to say it is nearly done . You see , I making it for my good wife Margaralot , who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own.
You must know , said Margalot , when they were split together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mumbe the witch who used to leave in the country of te Gillikins to the north of here.
The first test we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since.
I think the next glass cat then magician makes well have neither brains nor hearts , for then it will not object to catching mise and they prove of some use to us.
I 'm afraid I don't know much about the land of us.
Yousee I 've lived everybody 's life with a nonkey silent one and there was no one to tell me anything.
That is one reason you are unlucky , said the woman in a sympathetic tone.
I think I must show you my patchwork girl said Margalout , laughing at the boys ' ostonishment for she is rather difficult to explain.
But first I will tell you that for many years I have longed for a servant to help me with the housework work and to clean the meals and wash the dishes.
yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose.
A bed quilt makes patches of different kinds and colours of cloth onleat so together.
Sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up.
When I found id I said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl , for when she was brought to life she would not be as proud nor haughty as the glass cat is , for such a dreadful mixture of colours would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchgins are.
In the emerald city where our princess alsimalives green is the most popular color.
I will show you what a good job I did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.
Oh jo wexamined this carious contrivance with wonder.
Margalot had first made the girls form from the patch work quiled and then she had dressed it with the patch work skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same game material throughout.
The head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her.
Her hair was in brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat brains.
Gold is the most common metal in the land of os and is used for many purposes because it is very expensive .
No , I forgot and the brains exclaimed the woman.
Well that may be true , agreed Margaloc , but on the contary a servat with too many brains is sure to become pendent in high and mighty and feels above her work.
She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.
I think that she will continue for the other qualities are not needed in the servant.
She ran to her husband 's side at once and helped him lift the fore cattles from the fire.
Their contents had all boiled away , leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder.
very carefully , the magician removed this powder , placing it alltogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon.
No one saw him doing this . All they were looking at the powder of life , but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard.
Oh Jo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness.
He selected a small gold bottle with e pepperbox top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes.
Most people talk too much , so it is a relief to find someone who talks too little.

The grateful applause of the clergy has consequated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest.
The edict of Milane the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion.
But this inestimable privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of the truth . The emperor wrote the maxims of persecution and the sex which dissented from the Catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity.
constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderates and arities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation.
Some of the penal regulations were copied from the enics of dicletion and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who fell the hand of appression and pleated for the rights of humanity.
They asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the opostolical succession was interrupted , that all the bishops of the Ourope and Asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the perogatives of the Catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the African believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline.

The eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed.
It would have been more wonderful had he spoken without bidding.
He said Unchas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him . The dark hair had gone toward the forest.
If a rock or a rivilat or a bit of earth harder than comman severed the links of the clue , they followed the true eye of the scout , recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary.
extinguished brands were lying around a spring , The awfuls of a dear were scattered about the place and the trees wore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses.
A circle of a few hundred feet a sircumference was drawn and each of the parties took a segment for his portion.
The examination , however , resulted in no discoveries .
The whole party crowded to the spot where uncaspointed out the impression of a mocuson in the moist illuvion.
run back on costume brings me the size of the singer's feet
notwithstanding the high resolution of howkay he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to encur.
In his return to the camp , his acute and practiced intellects were intently engaged in divising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree in ferior to his own.
In other words , while he had implicit faith in the abilities of Bailem's to speak , he was somewhat skeptical about the subject of a bear singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs.
There was something in his air and demanner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind.
The ingenious hawky who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation.
The bear shook his shaggy side and then a well - known voice replied.
Can these things be returned to David breathing more freely as the truth begins to down upon him.
Come com return Hocki and make his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion . You may see a skin which if it is not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business.
The young man is in bondage and I fear his death will be decreed.
I greatly morned that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and I have sought a good habit that could lead me to him.
The task will not be difficult . Return David hesitating , though I greatly fear your presence would rather mitigate his unhappy fortunes.
The building which uncus was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation.
Four or five of the latter only lingered around the door of the prison o uncus - wary but close observers of the manner of their captive.
delivered an astrong tone of a cent , announced the gratification the savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared.
They drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter.
but the bear , instead of obeying , maintained the seat he had taken and growled.
The cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow up on his brothers and take away their courage , too . Continued driving improving the hand he received . They must stand further off.
Then , as if satisfied with their safety , the scout left his position and slowly entered the place.
It was silent and gloomy , being tenanted solely by the captive and lit by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cooquery.
Onkus occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude , being rigidly bound with both hands and feet by strong and painful withs.
The scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
What shall we do with the mingoes at the door ? They count six and the singer is as good as nothing.
The delawares are children of the tortise and they outstrippe the deer.
The Oncus , who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way , now recoiled and placed himself once more at the bottom of the lodge.
But hawk y , who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement , continued speaking more to himself than to his companion.
So onchus you had better take the lead while I will put on the skin again and trust in cunning for want of speed.
Well , what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention.
As soon as these dispositions were made , the scout turne to daven and gave him his parting instructions.
My pursuits are peaceful and my temper I humbly trust as greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettle that so direct and attack on his menhood , but there are none who can say that I have ever forgotten my faith in the lord , even in the greatest straits.
If you are not , then knocked on the head , you being a non - compasor will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed.
So thank you for yourself for making a rush or terry here.
bravely and generously has battled on my behalf and this and more will be in his service.
keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out severely and one of your shoutings which will serve to remind India that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be.
If they take your score as I trust and believe they will not depend on it and I will not forget the deed but revenge as they become true warriors and trusty friends.
He said david prceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him . I am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught the damnable principle of revenge.
Then crying a heavy sigh , probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned . He added it is what I would wish to practise myself as one without a cross of blood , though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian.
God bless you friend . I do believe your send is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeps a turnity before the eyes , though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation.
The white dog , he said , leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expressions of the other features is afraid.
will the herens here his groans.
The moheacan started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort.
He had no occasion to delay , for at the next instant a burst of chries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village.
ongess cast a skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.
I will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned.
I had always known him to be restless in his manner , but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrol belegitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred.
My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker 's street.
Without his scrapbooks , his chemicals and his homely antidiness , he was an incomfortable man.
I had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct.
I was absent for more than an hour.
The only dupikat which existed so far as I knew it was that which belonged to my servant banister , a man who was looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion.
The moment I looked at my table , I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers.
The proof was in three long slips . I had left them all together.
They all turned out that someone who had observed the key in the door , had known that I was out and had entered to look at the papers.
I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair which I did the most careful examination in the room.
A broken tip of led was lying there also.
Not only this but on the table , I found a small ball of black do or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
Above all things , I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.
To the best of my belief they were rolled up.
Did anyone know that this proof would be there ? No one saved the printer.
I was in such a hurri to come to you , you left your door open.
so it seems to me.
Now mister sulmbs at your disposal.
above wore three students one in each story.
Then he pproached it and standing on tipto with his neck craned , he looked into the room.
There is no opening except the one person said our learned guide.
I am afraid there are no signs here , said
One could hardly hope for any upon such a dirty day.
You left him in a chair , you say that through the window there.
The man entered and took the papers shed by shet from the central table.
As a matter of fact , he could not say sometimes for I entered by the side door.
how long it it takes to do that using every possible contraction acquarters of an hour not less.
then he tassed it down and seized the next.
He was in the midst of that when his return caused him to make a very hurried retreat , very hurried , since he had no time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.
Mister Salmas was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.
Homs held out a small chip with the letters an an and the space of clear wood after them you see.
What's a ni have always done you and the injustice there are others.
I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin , some trace of it might come through upon this polishe surface . I could see anything .
As homes drew the curtain , I was aware from some little regidity and anlertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency.
Holms turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor . Hello what is this.
homes hut ed out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.
What could he do ? He caught up with everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.
I understand you say that there are three students who use this stare and are in the habit of passing your door . Yes there are.
and they are all in for the examination .
One heartly likes to throw suspicion where there is no proofs.
Let us have suspicions . I will look after the proofs.
My scholar has been left very poor , but he is hard working and industrious . He will do well.
The top floor belongs to males mcclerin.
I do not go so far as that , but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely.
He was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life.
but I have occasionally done the same thing at other times.
did you look at these papers on the table.
How came you to leave the key in the door.
one in the room could get out , yes sir.
I really don't think he knew much about it mister holmes.
only for a minute or so.
Oh I would not venture to say sir.
You haven't seen any of them no sir.
It was the indian whose dark silouett appeared suddenly upon his blind.
He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.
The set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them.
No names please said as we knocked on the gilchris door.
Of course , he did not realize that it was y who was nocking , but nonetheless his conduct was very uncourteous and , indeed , under the circumstances , rather suspicious.
That is very important for homes.
You don't seem to realize the position.
to morrow as the examination.
I can ot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced.
It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.
I will take the black clar with me and the pennil cuttings good bye.
When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle , we again looked up at the windows.
He found a mountain fellow at the top.
He is the one with the worst record.
Why benister the servant what's his game in the matter.
He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.
My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation.
no good my dear Watson.
I think you have formed a conclusion.
Yes , my dear Watson , I have solved the mystery.
Look at that , he held out his hand.
on the palm were three little pyramids of black dohy clay.
and one more this morning.
In a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the colprit to compete for the valuable scholarship.
He could hardly stand still , so great was his mental egitation and he ran towards home with two eager hands outstretched , thinking " heaven that you have come.
You know him , I think so.
If this matter is not to become public , we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial.
no sir certainly not.
There was no man there , sir.
His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon the banister and the farther corner.
Just close the door said homes.
We want to know mister gilchrist how you and honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday.
For a moment , Gil Christ , with an upraised hand , tried to control his riving features.
Come come say Holme's Kindly . It is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.
Well , I'll not trouble to answer , listen and see that I do you know and justice.
He could examine the papers in his own office.
The Hindian I also thought nothing of.
When I approached your room , I examined the window.
No one less than that would have a chance.
I entered and I took you into my confidence as to these suggestions for the side table.
He returned home carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are where , with several sharp spikes.
No harm would have been done had it it not been that as he passed your door , he prceived the keey which had been left by the carelessness of your servant.
A sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs.
He put his shoes on the table.
gloves , said the young man.
Suddenly , he heard him at the very door . There was no possible escape.
have I told the truth mister gilgrust.
I have a letter here mister Solmes , which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night.
It would be clear to you from what I have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out.
It was simple enough sir , if you only know , but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know.
If mister saw them , the game was up.
In the debate between the singiers societies , her defense of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm.
the South she had not thought of seriously and yet , knowing of its delightful hospitality and miled climate , she was not a verse to Charleston or new orleans.
John Taylor , who had supported her through college , was interested in cotton.

Some others also bid the countries
You ought to know John if I teach negroes who scarcely see many people in my own class.
At any rate , I say go.
Here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused elderly people and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable.
She wonted a glance at the new books in periodicals and talked of great foreign anthropies and reforms.
So for the hundredh times she was thinking today as she walked alone up the back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms.
cotton she bassed.
She had almost forgotten that it was here with in touch and sight.
The glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her sretching awit to the northward.
It might be a bit poor try here and there , but most of this place was such desperate prose.
Her regards shifted to the green stocks and leaves again and she started to move away.
Cotton is a wonderful thing , is it not boyse , she said rather primly.
Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton , but at least one more remark seemed to be called four.
I don't know if will have anything in will comment . Miss Taylor 's letter is bornin cotton and well as as asking what's use she turned again to go.
I suppose though it's too early for them , then came the explosion.
Googles don't grow on the top sadvines but on the ground , new things like yem are so.
The golden fleece , the silver fleece he harkened.
Sometimes you tell me , please won't you.
Now for a half an hour she had been a woman talking to a boy . , not even mat she had been talking just talking . There were no people in the conversation , just things one thing taught .
The honorable chales smith who missed Sara's brother was walking swiftly up and down from Mister Easterley's Wall street office and his face was pale.
In the end , the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the senate.
Why should he not be like other man ?
She was not herself a notably intelligent woman . She greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others.
As she awaited her guess she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and as quiet tude for her social functions were few to night there were she checked them off on her fingers . Sir James Criton , the rich English menufacturer and Lady Criton 's Mister and Missus Vanderpol , Mister Harry Creswell an hiss sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guess that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of coden interests earlier in the day.
Missus Gray had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vivid cruelty to poor negroes , a subject she made ap point of introducing fourth .
She was therefore , most agreeably surprised to hear Mister crestwell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education.
Do you believe in education ? asked Mary Taylor.
I believe in the train of the people to their their capacity . The Englishmen here hartily seconded him.
But Creswell added copacity diffes in normous li between racees.
The bandor pools were sure of this and the Englishman instancing India became quite eloquent . Missus Gray was mistified but hardly dared admit et the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest crutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them.
Wals a Timley her wife added Criswell avoiding his sisters ' eyes.
but we're not exactly welcome.
The Taylor , however , related the tail of Sor to the Missus Gray's private ear later.
For Tunately said , mister vanderfol or their nose and sawtinors all ribing at a belof mutual understanding on most of these matters.
He knew the silver fleese his ansor as he must be ruined.
It was the first great sorrow of his life . It was not so much the loss of the cottin itself , but the fantasy of the whopes the dreams built around it.
Ah , the swamp , the cruel swamp.
The revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly until it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him with burning wonder.
he panted to know if she too knew or new and cared not or cared and knew not.
She was such a strange human accreature.
The world was water beiled in mists.
Then if it was a suddenly day the sun shot out hod and still no breath of air stirred the sgy was like long steel the earth steamed.
Where was the use of imagining.
The lagood had been level with the dikes a week ago and now.
Perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping.
He started at the thought , he hurried forth sadly.
He plashed to stamp along farther and farther onward until he neared the ramp art of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge.
Then he looked down at the lagoon was dry.
He stood a moment before , then turned and rushed upon the Eisland . A great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept a place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green , , tall , wet and willowy.
The squares of a sharp edge were just about to burst into bulls.
but one long moment he paused again with utter amazement , then lane dizzly against the tree.
He looked about and was astonished.
Here lies the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain . Someone had dug a an now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and cocked way , thus allowing it to empty directly.
He sat down weak the wildered and one thought was up er most sounds .
the years she died were
The hope and dream of harvest was upon the land.
up in the sick room or lay on the little whide bed.
The ned and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her . She had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strole for her life wosh narled and creeping fingers , but now , at last weakly , she opened her eyes and questioned.
For a while , she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure , her son and bird and tree.
She She , with a fleeting glance , gathered the shawl around her , then gliding forward , the wavering tremulus slipped across the road and into the swamp.
She had been born within its borders within his border . She had lived in groan and within its border she had met her love.
And she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton laborfore her.
The chair was empty , but he knew.
He darted through the trees and pawsed a tall man , strong but slimly made.
It is a very old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery liken which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity , so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables , the windows and the door place.
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door I think is like the gate it is never opened.
for it is a solid heavy , handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonrous bang behind the livery blackey who had just seen as master and misters off the park in a carriage and par.
a large open fireplace with dirty dogs in it and a barer boarded floor at the far end , fleeces of wolves sbacked up in the middle of the floor some empty cornbags.
and what through the left hand window.
several clothes morses a pillion , a spenning wale and an old box was open and stuffed full of coloured rags.
At the edge of this box their lives a great wooden dall which , so far as mudilation is concerned , bears a strong resemblance to the finest Greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose.
The history of the house is plain now.
but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the couches and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow billed ducks who are seasing the opportunity of gitting the grink with as much body in it as possible.
were The great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy mending the harnesses under the superintendents of Mister Goby the woddaw , otherwise satdler who entertains them with the latest tredleston gassap.
Hathe Surl often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned to look at the pleacing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usrally turned up like a screen and was more for entertainment than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round peterdishes there were ranged on the shells above the long deal dinner table or in the hobs of the great which always shone like jasper.
do not suppose , however , that the missus person was elderly or shrewish and her appearance was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty , with a fair complexion and sandy haire which made her light feet .
The family like this between her and her knees , Dina Moris with e contrast between her keenness and dinas surrafhic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary.
Her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a dame sol came with ag or shot seemed to take up an unfinished luxure as a barrel organ took up a tune , particularly at the point where it had left off.
The fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the wid ows and why I , consequently , missus poiser should scold molly the house built with unusual severity.
To all appearances , Molly had got through her after dinner work in an exemplary manner , had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissivly if she should sit down to her spinning till morning .
spinning indeed.
I never knew your equal for gallowsness.
who taught you to scrub a floor would like to know.
comb the wolf for the wio ows indeed.
That's what she'd like to be doing is
That's the way with you , that's the road you'd all like to go headlongs to ruin.
Mister Oat Lees andeed.
You are a rare prsitting down to your work a little while after time goes by.
My arons twie told me they put it down to warm.
could es it my darling . Bless your sweet face.
She's going to put the ironing things away.
I have to go into the barn to manage to see the without odd.
No no no tadty bitter feet wet , said Missus Poyser was carrying away her iron.
did see the screaming missus poyser running towards the table when her ei had fallen on the blue stream.
Toddy , however , had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of wabbling run and a large amount of fat on the neieb of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig.
and she was very fond of you too , Rechel.
I often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way.
which he had that severe illness and I was only leven years old . She used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt Rachel if I'm taken from you because she has a kind heart and I'm sure I've found it
and there's linden in the house as I could well spare you because I got lots of sheeting and table clothing and towling isn't made up.

We can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work the cording as he fits us for it and pulseus to it.
I can no more help spending my mife on trying to do what I can for the souls of others , then you could help running . If you hear little toddy crying at the other end of the house , the voice would go to your heart . You would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her.
I am afraid strong surents that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children for anything I have done.
I didn't preach without direction.

I have common patience with you.
By this time , the twea gentleman had reached the palings and had got down from their horses . He was playing they were meant to come in.
said Mister Irwin with his stately cordiality.
o ser dot mention it said Miti's poycer.
I doliving your kitchen.
Poiser is not at home is he.
said Captain Danny Thorne , sitting where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door.
No sir he isn't He's went to roseter to see Mister West , the Factor in the world .
But their father is in the barn sir if he'd be of any use.
No thank you . I'll just look at the welbs and leave a message about them with your shepherd.
I must come another day and see your husband . I want to have a consultation with him about horses.
for if his anywhere on the farm , we consend for him in a minute.
Oh sir , said missus person would rather better you wouldn't like it at all.
but you know more about that than I do sir.
I think I should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place.
I knowce Marm is in better order than any other with ten miles of us than as for the kitchen , he added , smiling . I don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it.
By the way , I've never seen your diary . I must see your diary missus Poyser.
This misus poisor said , blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her melt pans and would give just his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy.
Oh iave no doubt it's in capital order.
The Paris plan like that of the Chrystal Palace was a temporary exhibit.
The Pulonden ply hat was last temporary but not permanent supply before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotel clothes doores and dwellings in the vicinity of Holeburn vioduc.
Their messier's johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told.
The dynamo electric machine was robust for under all the variing speeds of waterpower and the pecissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety - nine seventeen years.
Owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers , a son has been frequently spoken of as annaponent of the alternating course
Why if we erect a station in the fall ? It is a great economy to get it up to the city.
There seems no good reason for believing that it will change.
broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them , he is pidyo in cratically upposed to loosen wastful methods to plans e vempire that neglect the poor at the gate.
Everything he has done has been amed by the consumption of energy , the contraction of space , the intensification of culture.
For some years , it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and , for that reason , was often urged against it .
It could not be used for electoral plating or deposition , nor could it charge to rige batteries , all of which are easily within the ability of the directurrent.
But when it came to the question of lighting a scattered suburb , a group of dwellings on the outskirts of remote country remains or far away the alternating currents in all the elements , save its danger was and ideal.
Isson was tolerant of shamm on shaddi and nothing would satisfy him that he could not stand cross examination by microscope , tube and galvanometer.
unless he could secure an engine with smoother running and more exact governent regulated than those available for his dinamo and the lamp at Ason realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light.
Mister Addison was a leader far ahead of the time.
He obtained the desired speed and load with a friction break , also a regulator of speed , but waited for an indicator to verify it.
Then again , there was no new way to lupricate an entry for continuous running and mister edison and from me that as I marine engines started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port , so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times.
Andison had installed his historic first great central station system in New York on the multiple arch system covered by his feeter and main invention , which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors , as against the straight to wire system throughout the tree
He soon foresaw that still greater aconomy would be necessary for commercial success , not alone for the larger territory , but for the compact districts of large cities.
The strong position held by the Edison's system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate empothus to incondicent lighting.
It was especially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when the yield of six or eight lamps to the horse bower was considered subject for congratulation.
The street conductors were of the overhead poll lime construction adwar stalled by the construction company that had been organized by adison to build equipped entral stations.
Meanwhile , he had called upon me to make a report of the three Wir system known in England as the Hopkinson , both doctor John Hopkinson and Mister Edison being independent and vendors at practically the same time.
I think he was perhaps more appreciative that I was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be good for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up.
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country.
They were later used as reserve bachines and , finally , with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edesonia but they remain in practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty three.
The arc labp and stall outside a customers ' premises or on a circuit for public streetlighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate , subject to rebate for hours when the lap might be out through accident.
He held that electricity should must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter.
There was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other invettors were also giving the subject bherthought the public took it for granted that any thing so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weded and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration.
Hence , the adison electoralitic meter is no longer used despite its axcellent qualities.
The principale employed in the adison electoralitic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to deacompose a chemical substance.
associated with the simple form of apparatus were various genious details and refinements to secure regularity of operations freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit current or damage.
The standard adison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination , another set being substituted.
On thecember eighteen , eighty - eight Mister Duw j Jecks read an interesting paper before the American institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time , with the meter then more generally in use than any other.
The others have been an operation too short a time to show definite results , although they also went quickly to a dividend basis.
In this connection it should be mentioned that the association of adison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the adnison made was accurate and that it'ssssss use was not expensive for stations and one thousand lights and that the best financial results were in variably secured an a station selling current by meter.
The meter continued in general service from eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century.
He watched to rewave the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain.
He felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would help him
The problem was solved.
We were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part.
We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.
Here she would stay comfortable and soothe the Mon with lovely plants and richardxotics rejoicing the heart of the old turn at the gardener who since poulysfirst raptrous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time.
Every chance she could speak after practice hours were over and after the clamorest amands of the boys upon her time where fully satisfied was ceized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers.
Then dear said Missus Witney , you must be kind to her more than ever think what it would be like for one of you to be away from home , even among friends.
Somehow , of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest day , it seemed as if she could bear it no longer .

At this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped Fronsye.

Dear me a jaculated old gentleman and the utmost amazement and at such a time I have had to get her here too.

He cried and highe dudgeen just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his mancy.
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time.
At last he came out of them and wiped his face vigerously.

Indeed , he had looked away with the purpose of noxseing it.
They think you are proud because you've been away to school or something.
There was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail.

In a few moments , he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swing his sih with that long , even stroke through few American boys ever learned.
Myri picked up Jherrius and said softly to herself , stripping one glittering ranch after another shivering when she thought of a show where rain dropps on her neck and hair.

That summer the reins had been so many and opportune that there was almost more than Shabata and his men could do to heep up with the corn . The orchard was a neglected wilderness.
I don't know all of them but I know them by Zar.
If I feel that way , I feel that way.
He reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet incipid fruit , long ivery coloured barries tipped with maint pink like white carrel that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through.
He dropped a handful into her lap.
Yes , don't you.
Oh , a much , only he seems kind of staying in a school teachery.
When they used to tell me about him , they always wondered whether she was n't a little in love with him.
It would serve you all right if she walked off with carl.

I am tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down
I wish you weren't so rettless and didn't get so worked up over things , she said , sadly.
Thank you he returned short
and you never used to be prosse to me.
I can't play with you like a little boy and , he said slowly . That's what you miss Marie.
But Amiel , if I understand all our good times are over , we can never do nice things together any more.
And Anyway , however , there's nothing to understand.
But but finally it will go away and things will be gentle as they used to.
I pray for you but it is not the same as if you pray yourself.
I can't pray to have the things I want him to say slowly and I won't pray not to have them not if I'm damned for it.

On Saturday , , the sea and broke in all with no land in sight.
The horizon seemed extremely distant.
My danger and suffering were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him , but now that I am well , nature has resumed its sway.
You seem anxious , my uncle . I said , seeing him continually with his glass to his eye
One might be with less reason than now.
I have not complaiting that the rat is slow but that the seat is so wide.
We are losing time and the fact is I have not come all this way to take a little saile upon a pulon on a raft.
He called the sea apo and I long wanted to a little sail.
Therefore , don't talk to me about views and prospects.
I take this as my auntswe and I leave the professor to buite his lips with impatience.
Sunday August sixteenth.
nothing knew whether the unchanged the wind freshes.
but there seemed no reason to fear.
The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves.
Truly the sea is of infinite wit.
The must be wide as the mediterranean they are atlantic and why not.
These thoughts additated me all day in my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours .
I shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance.
I saw at the hamburger museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length.
I suppose professor Leadon Brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pig , his eyes felt the ocean from side teside.
Tuesday August eighteenth.
During his watch I slept.
Two hours later , a terrible shock was
The work was headed up to a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms.
There's a whale walking , cried the professor.
The fight was beyond the question . Now the reptiles rose , they willed around our little raft with a repidity greater than that of expressed trads.
Two monsters only recreate all this commotion and before my eyes are rephiles of the primitive world.
I can distinguish the eye of the ictheassourus glowing like a red hot co and his large as a man's head.
it'sssss jaw is normal and , according to naturalists , it is arned with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth.
Those huge creatures attack each other with the greatest animosity.
Suddenly , the icteossourus and the plecius sourus disappear , leaving a war poll eddiing in the water.
As for if the assourus as he returned , the submarine came
The rowings lasts in the distance.
The weather , if we may use the term , will change before lawn.
The atmosphere is charged with vapors prvaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters.
The electricity light can scarcely penetrate through the dence curn which is dropped over the theatre in which the battle of the elements is about to be waged.
The air is heavy , the sea is calm.
From time to time , a spicy toufh of mise with yet some gleaming light left upon it trop down upon the dence floor of gray and loses itself in the ophag and a peneterable mass.
The atmosphere is evidently charged and searh charged with electricity .
The wind always lolled , but to acquire increased strength , the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of scary windy gusts in rushing storms.
There's a heavy storm coming on . I cried , pointing towards the horizon.
Those clouds seemed as if they were going to crush the sea.
On the mast already I see the light play of a lamin saint . Ar will'sfire The outstritch saile catches no a breadth of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead.
but if we have now ceased to advance , why do we leave that sale loose , which at the first shock of a tempest mecapsize us in a moment.
That will be the safeest no no never.
The pold of vapors contents in the water and the air put in the violet action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a wirldwin.
harnsters not.
From the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid life . Electric matter is in continual evolution from its component molicules because gashed elements of the air need to be slaved with moisture for innermable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam.
I referred to the thermometer which indicates the figure is o bliteratedg.

The raft is still to the southeast.
At noon , the violence of the storm redoubled.
Each of us is lashed into some part of the raft.
The waves rise above our heads.
Today seems to be we are lost , but I am not sure.
He nods his consent.
The far ball , half of it wide , half azere blue and the size of a ten inch shell , moved very about the raft but revolving on its own acess with thestonishing philocity as if whipped round by the force of the worlwind.
Here it comes , there it glides now . It is up the ragged stump of the mast that's it lightly leaps on the provision bag , descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine orrible.
We shall be blown up , but the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside . It approaches Harns who fixes his blue eye upon its sedily . It threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it.
A suffocating smell of nigtroted fills the air . it enters the throat it fills the longs.
We suffer stifling pains.
and how odd the directions will look.
poor ouice.
It was the white rabbit , returning , splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other . He came trotting along and in a great hurry , mutdering to himself as he came oh the duchess , the duchess.
Oh what would she be servage if I've kept her waiting.
I took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept panning her self all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today.
and yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've changed in the night.
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
I shall never get to twenty at that rate.
How cheerfully he seems to grin , how neatly spread his clause and welcome the offiches in with gently smiling jaws.
No , I'd made up my mind about it if I could I'll stay down here.
You be no use their putting their heads down and singing come up again dear.
I am so very tired of being all alone here.
and I think it's too bad that it is.
I wish I hadn't cried so much , said Alice as she swam about trying to find her way out.
I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being trowned in my own tears.
That will be a queer thing to be sure.
I am very tired of swimming around here oh mouse.
cried Aliceagain for this time the mouse was prsling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended.
We won't talk about her any more if he'd rather not
We want you to help us publish some leading works by luthers for the general American market . Will you do it.
The condition is that I will be permitted to make luther talk American , so to speak because you will never get people in or outside the Lutheran church actually to read luther and less we talk as you would talk day Americans.
Let us begin with his commentary ongalations.
The undertaking which seemed so attractive when biewed as a literary task proved the most difficult one and at times became a precsive.
It was written in latin.
the work had to be condensed.
A word should now be said about the origin of Luther's commentary ungulations.
Much later , when a friend of his was preparing an addition of all his latin works , he remarked to his home circle that if I had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine mygelations fornstance.
In other words , these three men took away the lecures which he recommended to his students in the course of galations and then prepared the manuscript for the printer.
The present , like no other of Luther's writings , the central thought of Christianity , the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ , merits alone.
but the essence of Luther's lectures is there.
The lord who has given us the power to teach and to hear let him also give us power to serve and to do lop to.
The word of our god shall stand forever.
In every way , they sought to undermine the authority of saint Paul.
They say to the galations you have no right to think highly
He was the last aturned of Christmas
polking later in his beneath us.
Indeed , he persecuted the church Christ for a long time.
Do you suppose they god , for the sake of a few moothren heretics , would accept his entire church.
Against these boasting false apostles , Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority in ministry.
As the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person , so the minister of christ should exult his office in order to gain uthority among men.
Paltics pridein his ministry not to his own praise but to the prize of god.
Paul and a couple of men et cetera.
Either he calls ministers through the agency of men or ecalse them directly as he called the profits apostles.
pald the clars of the false apostles were called hersent neither by men nor by man.
The most they could claim is that there were several others.
He mentioned the apostles first because they were appointed direct by God.
The call was not to be taken lightly.
For people the possess knowledge is not enough.
is spoils one's best work.
When I was a young man , I thought Paul was making too much of his call.
I did not then realize the importance of the ministry.
I knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught a fistrene set of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting.
This is no sinful pride ; it is wholly pride.

This should go far and shetting them mouse of the fals apostles.
Although the brethrin with me is not a possles like myself , , they are all in one mind with me think right and teach as I do.
They do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate , they go whether the cuestions are.
Why did they not invade the Catholic provinces to preach their doctrine to God , princes , bishops and doctors , as we have done with the help of god.
We look for that reward which I have not seen nor ear heard , neither entered into the heart of man.
Not all the galations had improved .
This means it cannot be contaminated.
They remained divine regardless of men's opinion.
Wherever the meanings of grammar are found , there is the holy church even though anti - crise reins there.
So much for the title of the epistole now follows the greeding of the apostlee verse three.
Grace be too you and peace from God the father and from our board Jhesus Christ.
The terms of grace and peace are common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood.
The great of the apostles is prefreshing.
Grace involves the remission of sins , peace and a happy conscience.
The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.
experience proves this.
However , the grace and piece of god will.
Men should not speculate about the nature of God.
was not enough to say from God the father.
To do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure into comprehend his infinite majesty.
He came down to earth , lived among men suffered , was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him.
embrace him and forget about the nature of god.
He he not crist himself say I am the way in the truth and the life no man comes with unto his father but by me.
When you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification , you may be as profound as you like.
We are to hear Christ has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher.
At the same time , palkanfirms are a creed that Christ is very god.
That Christmas is very God is apparent in that Paul scribes to him divine powers equally with the father , as , for instance , the power of the spense grace and peace.
To bestow peacing grace lies in the province of God , who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot.
Otherwise , Paul should have written grace from God the father and peace from our board Jesus Christ.
The Arians took the choice of a noble and perfect reacur superior even to the angels , because by him god created heaven and earth.
Mohammad also speaks highly of Christ.

He never loses sight of the purpose of his opistle.
Not gold or silver or passial lambs or angels but himself four.
not for a crown or a kingdom or goodness before sins.
underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences.
How may we obtain corrections of our sins.
Pauliansers the man who is named Jesus Christ and the son of God gave himself for our sinse.
Since Christ was given for our sins , it stands to reason that they can be put away by our own efforts.
This sentence also defines our sins as great , so great in fact that the whole world could not make ammends for a single sin.
The greatness of the ransom Christ some a god indicates this.
The vicious character of San is brought out by the words who gave himself for since
But we are careless , we make light of sin.
We think that by doing doing little work or getting married , we can dismiss
This passage then bears the fact that all men are sold an der sin.
This attitude springs from a false conception of sin . The conception that san is a small matter easily takin care of by good works that we must present ourselves to god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sense.
The attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others.
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them.
On the other hand , we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair.
He passes a bruptly from people through ideas and numbers , and from ideas and numbers the people from the heavens to men , from science to physiology . He confuses a rather does not distinguish subjects between object first and final causes and his dreams of how metrical figures are lost in a flios of sense.
but the influence which I have been exercised upon my besterity is partly a misunderstanding.
In the supposed teths of this dialogue , the Neo platinests found hidden meanings and connections with the Jewish and Christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quiet at variante with the spirit of plato.
They were absorbed in his theology and where under the minion of his name , , that which was truly great in truly correct in him , his effort to realize in connect ofstrections was not understood by them at all.
There is no danger of the Mardern commentators on the temeas falling into the ibbisurdities of the new Yo platnests.
In the present day , we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted by himself and by the contemporary history of thought.
The fancies of the neo pladnists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a failure of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the Christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own lives .
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and , in case , they are apposed to him.
We do not know how much he would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the totrillogis which he had expressly connected was ever present to his mind.
The dialogue is primarily concerned with animal creation , including under this term , the heavily bodies and with man himself as one among the enimals.
but he has not as yet fined this antemediate territory which lies between medicine and methematics , and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in rinking feries of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul.
With heratlitis he acknowledges the perpetual flooks like an excageros He is served the predominance of mine . Although he admits an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subdoing like the pifigorians he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number.
Many if not all the elements of the prie of cretic philosophy are included in the timeas.
It is sprobable that the relation of the ideis to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times in his life.
The ideas also remained but they have become types in forms of male animal spurting fish .
The style and plen of the tomeis tifferd greatly from bad of any other of the platanic dialogues.
But Plato does not have the same mastery of his instrument which hakes imits in the fedres or simposium.
nothing can exceed the beauty or arbe of the introduction in which he uses words after his accustomed manner.
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is holdi given up.
He could ride in one style but not in other ways . The Greek language had not as yet meant fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena.
Hence , we find the same sort of quosin ourselves in the temeos of Plato , which characters arizes the philosophical poem of the cricious.
There is a ont of slow and often a defect of ribhen the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a grater use of epposition in more repetition than occurs in playtols earlier ritings.

but aready at the point of economic evolution and stating the emergence of the lady 's specialized consemption of goods as evidence of pecuniary strength has begun to work out in a moreol ess celebrite system.
The utality of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivotive growth.
Such consumption as fals by women is mellion siddental to their work . It is a means to their continued labour and not to consemption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life.
With the further advance and culchure , this may change into simple custom of a less fregrous character , but whatever the theoretical basis of the distinction , which is maintained , whether it be at a bu or a large conventionality , the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.
In the nature of things , lexuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class.
under the taboo , mentioned victels and more particular , certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.
grenkiness and the other pathological consequences of the free ears of stimulants , therefore , tend in their turn to become unerific as being a marke at the second remove of the superior stateus of those who are able to afford the indulgence.
It has even happened that the name for certain disease conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonum for noble or gentle.
The consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master.
With many quofifications with more quolifications as the patriarcal tradition has gradually weakened , the general rute is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters.
The objection , of course , presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household pereprenalia is an obvious exception to this area , but it will appear in the sequel dis ecception is much more obvious and substantial.
The custom of testiv gatherings probably ariginated on motives of commidiality and religion . These moatives are also present in the late development because they do not continue to be the soul 's motives.
There is a more alaborate system of ranking grates.
This de frentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the continuous inheritance of gentlity.
Many of these affiliated gentlemen of lisure are at the same time less men of substance in the raw right , so that some of them are scarcely at all aether sonly party to be rated as carious consumers.
Many of them , however , , make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron , may be classed as a serious consumer without qualification.
Many of these again and also many of the others are strucracy of listi grye having turned toched to the people a more or less comprehensive group of carious consumers in the persons of their wifes and children , their servants retain ers et cetera.
The wearing of uniforms are liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may be said to be amark of servitude and astensible.
The wearers of uniforms and liveries may be greatly divided into two classes : the free and the Servine were the noble and the ignoble.
but the general distinction is not a tatter count to be overlooked.
So those officers which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble , such as governments fighting hunting for the care of arms and cutrments and the like . . In short , those switch may be classed as sustensibly predatory employment .
I never , in these cases , the menial service question has to deal directly with a primary leisure employment of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected onarific character.
The livery becomes obnoxious to who is required to wear it.
In a general way , though not clearly nor consistently , these two groups coincide.
The dependent who was first delegated for these stuties was the wife or the chief wife and , as would be expected in the late development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarly performed gradually narrows , the wife remains the last.
but as we descemd the social scale , the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarous leasure in consumption devolve upon the wife alone.
In the communitys of western culture , this point is common found among the low imiddle class.
If beautiful comfort is achieved and it is more less portutous circumstances if they are , it must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves through the great economic law of wasted effort.
The man of the household can also do something in the direcion and , indeed , he commonly does , but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums , the men and , presently , also the children totally seize to consuming valuable goods for apearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household pecuniaritecency.
very much of the squallorand discomfort will be indured before the last trouble ET or the last preparation of pecunaritie being put away.
There is no class and no country that has yielded so obviously before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need.
The question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the person's whose comvictions it is desired to affect.
Each will serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth.
The mudernerganization of industry works in the same direction , also by another line.
It is evident therefore that the present trend of development is in the diraktion of hihtening the utility of conspicous consumption as compared with leisure.
It is also noticable that the service ability of consumption is a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community when human contact with the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest.
consemption becomes a larger element in the sander of living in the city than in the country.
Among the country 's population , its places are to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighboring gossip sufficiently to serve the light general purpose of private repuit.
The result is a great mability of the labor imploint in printing , perhaps greater than in any other equally well - defined and consetrable buddy of workmen.
under the simple test of affectiveness for advertising , we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consemption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary amulation pretty evenly from the outset.
but the current course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme . Leisure held first place at the start and came toold e rank further above wasteful consumption of goods , both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceful culture.
are the circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and whatever is of human use.
I reconciliation between the two conflicts and requirements is affected by resort to making believs men and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed . Many organizations have founded with some specious objects of amiliration and bodied in their official style entitled there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the tack is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effect cial economic value of their traffic.
The important features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated.
Throughout the entire evolution of conspicious expenditure , whether of good services or human life , is the obvious implication that in order to affectually mend the consumer's good fame , it must be an expenditure of superfluities.
As used in the speech of everyday life , the word carries an undertone of depression .
The use of wood waste as a technical term , therefore , impries no deprecation of the motives or of the end' sart by the constumer under this canon of conspicuous waste.
but it is another ground worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday everyday life implies therprication of what is characterized as a suastepull.
In strict accuracy , nothing should be included under the head of conspicious waste , but such expenditure as his encured in the grond of an invitious pecuniary comparison.
and Artica may be useful in wastful both and it's setelited to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in varying proportions.
And often my mother said while on her lap I laid my head . She feared for time I was not made but for e turnity.
How we to be denied each other 's society.
Why are we divided.

We used to dispute about politics and religion.
Her Torian cleredymen's daughter was always in the minority of one in her house of violin discent and radicalism.

I am not depreciating when I say that in these times it is not rare.
but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you con salt your own happiness.
You will say that a woman has no need for such caution . There can be no peril in it for her.
The more she engages in her proper duties , the last leisure will be for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation.
to those duties , you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity.

Keswick Marche twenty second eighteen thirty - seven dear madame.
Your letter has given me great pleasure and I should not forgive myself if I di not tell you so.
In this second letter also she spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the lakes.
On August twenty seventh eighteen thirty seven she writes.
Come come I'm getting really tired of your absence.
Saturday after Saturday comes around and I have no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then being told that misseas come oh dear.
In this monotonous lifemind , that was a pleasant event.
I wash wonder recur again , but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness the instrangement of this long separation will wear away.
My eyes fall into tears when I cantrast the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state I now live in uncertain that I never feel true contrition wondering in thought , indeed longing for holiness which I shall never never obtain smitonat times to the heart with the conviction that gasly calvinistic doctrines are true darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death.
If Christian perfection is necessary for selbation , I shall never be saved . My heart is a very hot bed for sinful thoughts and when I decide on an action , I scarcely remember to look to my redemer for direction.
And meantime , I know the greatness of Jehova . I know the perfection of his word . I adore the purity of the Christian faith . My theory is right , my practice is horribly wrong.
The Christmas holidays came and she returned to the parsonage and to that happy home sircle in which alone their nature expanded amongst all the other people . They shriveled through more or less.
Indeed , there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters would produce the same result.
She had went out into the village on some errand as she was descending down the steep street . Her foot slipped on the ice and she fell He was dark and no one saw her mischance till , after a time , her grons attracted the attention of a passor by.
Unfortunately , the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.
However , remembering what you told me , namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision the Aurs and that you are resolved to submit with resognation to that decision whatever it might be , I hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent and may be all for the best.
After this disappointment , I will never dare ruckin with certainty about the enjoyment of pleasure again . It seems as if some fatality stood between you and me.
I am not good enough for you and you must be kept from the contamination of two intimate society.
A good neighbor of the brontes , a clever , intelligent yorkshure woman who keeps a drugis shop and half her worth of occupation , her experience and excellent sense , holds the position of village doctress and nurse and , as such , she has been a friend for many a time of trial and sickness and death in the households round told me a characteristic little incident connected with tabby's ractured leg.
Tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was , as charlotte mentioned it , one of the family.
He refused at first to listen to the careful advice . It was repugnant to his liberal nature.
This decision was communicated to the girls.
Tabby had tended them in their childhood and none else should tend her in her infirmity
Atd the time , they were sad and silent and the meal went away and touched by any of the three.
She had another thing on her mind this Christmas .
But Anne had begun to suffer dis before the holidays and charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jealous or igilance of some wild creature that changes her very nature if dangers hreatens her young.
stum bynxiety for this little sister , she upbraded her mistakes for her fancies comparison to her health.
Still , her heart had received a shock in the perception of Ane's delicacy and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing for exiety which was so full of sedon pings of fear.
I doubt whether Bronwell was maintaining himself at this time.
To celebrate the arrival of her son , Sylvia gave him a splendid supper to which he had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance.
Without saying it positively , she made me understand that being herself and a lustrious member of the republic of letters , she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect.
In order to please her , I spoke to her about the abbey conti and I had occasion to quote too many lines from that profound writer.
Madam corrected me with a patronising air for my pronunciation of the word scomvra , which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced scure and she added that I ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in Paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life.
Her face was in an igma ford in spired every one with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively , there was not one beautiful feature she could not be called handsome , but no one could have thought her ugly.
Sylvia was the adiration of France and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her , especially of the playse of marivo , for without her , his comedies would never have gone to prosterity.
Sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit , for she knew that she was virtuous only because her love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters , although she was satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue.
Two years before her death , I saw her face as daughter character of a married Anne in the comedy of Meravox and , in spite of her age and declining health , the allusion was complete.
She was honourably buried in the church of Saint Sovere without the sightest opposition from the venerable priest who , far from sharing the anti christian intolerance with of the clergy in general , said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good Christian and that the earth was a common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind.
You will forgive me dear reader if I have made you tend the funeral of Sylvia ten years before her death . Believe me , I have no intention of performing the miracle . You may consol yourself with the idea that I shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor sylvia dies.

His house had the management of everything . She never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept all together because he never asked her to render any accounts.
On the sixth of April , eighteen - thirty of the church of Jesus Prist of Latterday Saints were formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence.
Its origin was small a germ and an insignificant seed hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
Instead of but six regularly affiliated members and , at most , two squore of adherence , the organization numbers a hundred thousand souls.
In place of a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have communicate there , now there are about seventy stakes in Zion and about seven hundred organized wards in each ward and stake with its full compliment of officers and presed organizations.
The practice of gathering its proselites into one place prevents the building up and strengthening branches and , in much as extencive and strong organizations are seldom with broad very ironeous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church.

As the sable of the press comments against the brutality of the missourians , I quote apparagraphs from the Quincy arguss March sixteen eighteen thirty nine.

the People contessed these measures one by one in the courts , presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure.
Then the church was disincorporated and its property was real and personal confisicated and was shiated to the government of the united states and , although the personal property was soon restored , real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the court receivers and the Morman church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property.

Alexander clunched the two hands at his sides.
The stop in Queen's town , the tedious passage of the mercy were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
She blushed , smiled and fonbled his card in her confusion before she ran up stairs.
Alexander pased up and down the hallway buttening and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to his living room.
The room was empty when he entered.
Alexander did not sit down.
I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that some splendit was going to turn up.
I thought it might be sister and cousin Mike would come along.
She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool on the opposite side of the hearth , her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl.

When a private in the Ape cavalry , he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age , but unexpectedly , he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac.
The bond of union thus affected could never be severed and , although Bensoff's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement , he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer.
A Mik , his master , he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power , but his inexhaussible memory made him a living in cyclopedia and , for his stock of anecdotes and troopers , Tals , he was matchless.
As vast as his legs could carry him serve , a dack had made his way to the top of the cliff.
It was quite true that a vessel was hardly more than six miles from the shore , but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision , the rigging of the top mass alone was visible above the water.

She is undersaile , but she is counted Timishef's yacht . He was right.
If the count were on board , a strange fatality would bring him to the presence of his rival.

The wind being adverse , the Dobrena did not make very rapid progress , but as the weather , in spite of a few clouds , remained calm and the sea was quite smooth , she was enabled to hold the steady course.
Servadack took it for granted that the dogrina was endeavoring to put in.
A narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which , even in the rougfest weather , would ensure the calmness of its waters.

Captain Servadack hastened toward him.

Never mind now , the captain n we will talk about that and buy.

Are you certain that this is a mediterranean. ?
For some moments , he seemed perfectly stupefied and then , recovering himself , he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions.
To all these inquiries , the count responded in the affirmative. .
Some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements.
You will take me on board . , will you not.
My yard is at your service sir , even should you required to make a tour around the world.
The count shook his head.
Before starting , it was indispensible , but the engine of the Dugrena should be repaired to fly under canvus only in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult.

A slight dimmunution I may eccessively high temperature which has prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things , but whether this was to be attributed to any alterration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide.

Her seagoing qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
After an opprenticeship on a merchant ship , he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant . An mecount appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spending further greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters.

The ocean reigned supreme.
All the images of his past life floated upon his memory . His thoughts spread away to his native France , only to return again to wonder whether the depths of the ocean would reveal any traces of the Adgerian watropolis.
He said it was not impossible . He murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely.
would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible.
Another circumstance was most remarkable.
To the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope , the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of five fathoms and , although the sound persevered continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area , the differences of level were insignificant , not corresponding in the emmy degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terrassed like the seats of an empatheatre.
You must see lieutenant . I should think that we are not so near the coast of Algeria as you imagined.
After pondering a while , he said if we were farther away , I would expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fabhoms five fathoms.
Its depth remained in variable still four or at most five fathoms and although it'sssss bottom was siduously dredged , it was only to prove it was bearon of marine production of any type.

I stood with my back to the wall because I wanted a sword reaching out in the dark for me.

Hawken shall be your constant companion for the farmer.
He should not leave you day or night , whether you are working or playing or sleeping.
I named nine others and said.

I set guards over everyone in that house.
So no tales got out to the neighbors , besides there was a lonely place and , by good luck , none came the way.
Their eyes danced , big toreleaf stood up and stretched himself.
I'm stiff from a long sitting . He said I asked him to fight . I turned to the farmer.
This is our last feast with you , I said.
By the beard of Owd no crying you have taken our joke like a man.
My men pounded the table with their fists.

In a moment , he communicated his thoughts to his companions and in the next moment they resolved to turn back and carry her off to please rudol for the wrich who are open - handed , always find parisides ready to encourage their bad propensities and thus to conceive this wicked design to communicate it approve it resolve on ravish enly ocadia and to carry that design into effect was the work of a moment.
They drew their swords , hit their faces and the flaps of their cloaks , turned back and soon came in front of the little party who had not yet giving thanks to God for the escape from those hodacious men.
Finally , one party went off exalted and the other was left in desolation and will.
redollfol rived at his own house without any impediment , Hawleocadious parents reached their heart broken and despairing.
Meanwhile , Rudolefo had locati safe in his custody and in his own apartment.
ctuchos me and I embed.
mother do your father do you hear me.
it is the only ammen'se ie ask you about the wrong you have done me.
She found the door but it was locked outside.
She succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight appeared so brightly that she could distinguish the color of some damask hanging in the room.
She saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince brather that of a private gentleman.
among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucific of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window.
This person realized witthough he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect , not thinking it advisable to acquaint them but what had passed between him and the girl.
On the contrast , he resolved to tell them that he regretted his violence and was moved by a tear . He had only carried her halfway towards his house and then let her go.
Choking with e motionlocadia made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them.
That would be very well . My child replied to her father . If your plan were not lieable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning . I no doubt this image had been missed by its owner and he would have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there.
What you had best do my child is to keep it and pray that sins were a witness to your undoing . It will daign to vindicate your course by its righteous judgment.
Thus , the humane and right - minded father comforted his unhappy daughter and her mother embraced her again , did all she could to sooth the feelings.
She meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest to retirement , never letting herself be seen , but shunning every eyelisted should read her misfortune in her face.
Time rolled on bhe the hour of her delivery arrived , it took place in the upbost secrecy where the mother took upon her the office of midwife as she gave birth to a son , one of the most beautiful ever seen.
When the boy walked through the streets , blessings were showered upon him by all who saw him , blessing upon his beauty on the mother , the bore him up the father that begat him upon those who brought him ub so well.
One day , when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a friend , he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horseman.
The bed she too well remembered was there and te bove all the cabinet on which had stood the image ye had taken away was still in the same spot.
Lowis was out of danger in a fortnight and a month he rose from his bed and drewing all that time . He was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child.
Thus saying , ampressing the crucifix to her breast , she fell fainting into the arms of Danna Issafania , who was a gentle woman to whose six pityes a natural cruelty as to man instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl shetting over her so many tears that their needed no other sprinkling of water to recover the ocadia from her soon.
I have quit doing things to tell you since I said dornlas ta fangye to her husband lo criam and the substance of which is this the fainting girl before you tis your daughter and the boy is your grandson.
This truth which I have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we have both beheld that of our son.
Just then , locatea came to herself and embracing the cross seemed to change into a sea of tears and the gentleman remained in artebe wilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end the whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimones.
So persuasive were her intreaties and so strong resurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she thought they were induced to confess that one summer's night she had mentioned her and another friend being out on a stroll with redolful they had been concerned in the adoption of a girl whom he dolfol carried off whilst the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could.
For god's sake , my lady mother gave me a wife who would be a friendly companion , not one who would discuss me , so that we may both bur evenly and with mutual good will to yogimpost Armas by heaven , a sad of pulling this way and that way and fretting each other to death.
Her bearing was graceful . An animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked to maides with wax slights and silver cantle sticks.
al rose to do her reverence , as if something from heaven had meraculously appeared before them but gazing at her and trancing with admiration , not one of them was able to address a single word to her.
She reflected on how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever and racked by the intensity of her emotions . He suddenly changed color , Her head dropped and she fell forward in ta swoon into the arms of the dismaye ast to fania.
His mother had left her to him as her destine protector . When she saw that he too was insensible , she was teare making a third and would have done so had he not come to himself.
No then son of my heart , that this fainting lady is your weal bridge . I say it is true because she is the one whom your father and I have chosen for you and the portrait was supretence.
Just at the moment when the tears of the piting beholders flow fastest and their ere jaculations where most expressive of despair , locatia gives signs of recovery and brings back gladness toh the hearts of all.
When she came to her senses and blushing to find herself and whether her her arms would have disengaged herself or Sidneura , he said that you must not strive not to withdraw from the arms of him who holds you in his soul.
This was done for the event took place at a time with the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of amarriage without any of the practical formalities which are now so properly required.
Nor Ass seemed less surprised than they were and ta bedter to assure himself or so wonderful a fact . He begged localia to give him some token which should make perfectly clear to him that which , indeed , he did not doubt since it was authenticated by his parents.
You know Captain Lake.
said the Lord shelford , addressing me.
He had his hand on his shoulder.
their cousins . You know , we are all cousins.
Whatever lord Chelford said , missed brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile.
but her greeting to the captain leake was more than usual haughty and frozen and her features were particularly proud and pale.
At dinner leake was easy and amusing.
I'm glad you would like it , says the teacher , chuckling bheningnantly over his shoulder.
I believe I have a little taste that way . Those are all real . You know those jewels.
and he pleased it with that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little Paralela gram with a gleam of sly amusement.
I was thinking it's very like the aparts answered , the captain softly smiling on.
Afterwards , Lake laughed quietly , still looking at the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
and wiled her face two more suddenly and noisily , the mahuor of the joke seemed quite te call for and he glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes , but the gallat captain did not seem to proceive it and , after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently thack to missus darthy only remarking.
To you know , Lape Oh , I really can't tell but he'll soon be tired of country life.
He's not a man for country quarters.
I had a horrid dream about him last night .
Oh I know that's born brandon.
All the time he was talking to me was angry little eyes were following lyake.
The lake declined the carriage at night.
and he added something still less complimentary.
but not these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly.
In the meantime , I had formed a new idea for her.
By this time , Bor Chelfard Amalder returned and was disgusted with myself . I ruminated about my want for generalship.
and he made a little dip of his cane towards the branded hall over his shoulder.
He asked , so they said , but that would I think have been worse.
The old fellow's been a little bit wild . He beonds a bovet once.
The professor is a very good fellow , I can assure you.
I don't know when you can't say how you find gentlemen to find wickedness only as an obscure female . I speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county.
While you know Rady women like wicked fellows , it is a contrast . I suppose but they do and I'm sure from what bract has said to me , I know him intimately that Dorcis likes him and I can't cenceive why they are not married.
There Wal continued silent for the greater part . Neither was quite satisfied with the other , but Rachel at last said.
Now that's impossible ready for . I really don't think I once thought of him all the sevening except just when Wally was talking.
There was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging bowhs and witheredleaves and the modl bites and shadows glided oddly across his palefeatures.
don't insult me Stanley by talking again as you did this morning.
When I say it is altogether on your own account.
Mark my words , you find him too strong for you i and two deep.
I 'm very uneasy about it , whether it is , I can't help it.
To my mind , there is always been something inexpressibly awful in the family fus.
The mystery of their origin , their capacity for evolving leden faculties of crime and the stedy bytality with which they survive the herse and speak their deep mouth middlinitees in every newborne generation have associatd them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and e special say tack action.
The floor more than anything else showed the great age of the room.
My bad was unexceptional but comfortable , but in my vision mood I could have wished it a great deal more modern.
it's curntins were thick and feet ed tapistry.
All the frniture belonged to other times.
I should trouble you with my train of thoughts or fancies but I began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story watching experimentally in a haunted chaberer.
I did not even take the pecaution of smoking up the chimney.
I bullblelighted my route.
A cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows.
the Sumber old trees like jigantic herse pluomes black and awful.
Somehow I had grown nervous.
A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly.
It was not very past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up front the little garden wicket of Redmont's farm.
While she was better , though she had had a bad night.
So there came a step and a little rustling of Feminin dreeperies the small door opened and Rachel entered with her hand extended and a pail smile of golcam.
Women can hide their pain better than we men and bar it better too , except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice.
But poor Rachel Lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which ennables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile.
This transit spring and lightning up are beautiful glambours beguidling our senses.
There was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was nutery chol and comforting and she returned the great as kind and felt more like her former self.
Rachel's pale and sharpend features and dilydid ye struck her with a painful surprise.
He was been so ale my poor rechel.
ill and trouble my dear troubled mind and miserably nervous.
poor rechel heard nature recoil from deceit and she told everything as much of the truth as she dared.
She spoke with a sudden energy which partook fear and passion and flushed her cheek and made her languid eyes flash.
Thank you Rachel , my cousin Rachel , my only friend.
Chelford had a note from Mister Walder this morning , another note about his coming delay and some of his having to see some person who was abroad continued dorkess after a little pause.
Yes something everything said , Rachel hearredly looking frowndingly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers.
he said Rachel.
and the wane original having spoken , she sat down in the same sort of obstraction again beside Dorkus and she looked full into her cousin's eyes.
of Mark Wilder I say Gues His name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply that you will never ask me to speak again about him.
It is an antipathy and intipathy I can not get over dear Dorguess . You may think it is madness , but don't blame me.
I have very little to love now and I thought you might love me as I have begun to love you.
and she threw her arms around her cousin's neck and Breeveery Chol at last burst into tears.
dorguess in her strange way was moved.
I like you still Rachel . I'm sure I'll always like you.
You resemble me , Rachel . You are fearless and inflexible and generous.
Yes Rachel , I do love you.
Thank you Darkastear.
He began ta confused complain about the wizard who advantished behind the curtain on the left.
give not so earnest to mind because of memories of child.
a golden fortune and a happy life.
He was like a tmy father in a way and yet he was not my father.
Also , there was a stripling page who turned it to a maid.
This was so sweetily and in some manners I do think she died.
but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came.
Sister nol , do you hear these marvels.
take your place and let us know what the crystal can show to you.
He is not a young master though I am an old man.
Fourth , with all the rants at the opening of the tent to see what might be a miss , but the master will , who peeped out first , needed no more than one glance.
He gave way to the others very readily and retreated unperceived by the squire in Mistress fitzzuth to the rear of the tet.
cries of unnotting ham a' not accaim.
Before them , he fled the stroller and his three sons and were terrified.
What the tumult and righeting cried out the squire athoritatively and he turned twice on the silver whistle which hung on his belt.
Nay , we followed their request most politely , most nervous about the little stroller.
and then they became vexed and would have nashed your purse for us.
I could not see my boy injured excellence but he was doing his duty as one of Cumberland' sons.
So I did push this fellow.
It is easy to say George game well sharply as he turned upon the crowd.
She monouse to people cries and I blushed for my fellow incam.
Finally , we can submit with good grace.
to his fine for you to talk to an old man answer the lean Sullin a prentice.
but I restled with this fellow and do know that he played on fairly in the second bout.
spoke to the squire about losing all the patients and it was to him that I gave another person consolation.
Come to me man here . Here he raised his voice til louder.
The Strollers took their part with hardyzasse now that they had some chance of beating off their foes.
robit in the little tumplwer between them tried to force the squire to stand back and very valeanly to these two comport themselves.
The headand chief of the riot then nodtingham he printice with clenched fists and threatened Monty Sha.
The squire helped to thrust the all in and entered swiftly himself.
There be silent everyone lives he began , but the capture of a prentice set up an instant chance .
silence unive cried monfiche.
He felt that in finding the whiserd's black clothes , the squire was quite out of breath.
Thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent , a robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout.
A moffiche a must be shae game well to the rescue.
Taking advantage of these thesquires , you men doubled their efforts and were incouraged by robins and the little strollers crying throughout waigyt to him.
George Montfe Sha will never forget this day.
What is your name ? Lording asked the little stroller .
ropind fits well
and the mind will become rats.
right willingly , for between us we have won the battle answered robin.
I'd like you Will you are the second will that I have met inliked with in two days . Is there a sign in that.
Montfe she called out for a robin to give him an arm.
My friends said mountain sha fantly to the restlers bear us escorts so far as the sheriff 's house.
It will not be safe for you to stay here now.
Pray follow us with mind and my lord char iffs man

Master Monseu , the sheriff of nodding hamb , was mightily put about when told of the rioting.
and the henry might return to England at any moment.
have your child if the boy also will n't be . She answered , feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then.
He made an effort to hide his condition from them all and Robin felt his fingers tightend around his arm.
begged me to a room with the sheriff 's child quickly.
but who is plucky ? it was speeve.
He is my esquire excellency , returned Robin with a ticnity.
Mistress Fitzoth had been carried off by the sheriffes daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house , so that Brouh alone had the care of Molti her .
Robin was glad that that they were left with their own devices.
The wind ed certainly bring back the colourd to the squire's cheeks.
These escapates are not for the old games well led his day has come to twilight.
Will you forgive me now.
It will be a disappointment for me.
no thanks , I am glad to give you such easy happiness.
You are a worthy leat will presently whispered crobind the wine is a marvel.
I will show you some pretty tricks.
young fits had been commanded to his mother's room , so as he had come out from his converse with the squire.
It fell in an anxious interview . Mistress fitterth arguing for and against the squire's project by breath.
He must all robin think of his father what would he counsel.
If for a while you begger yourself , I cannot stay you.
But take it will stay alive and monfy her shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by such briave a sight , for you will narror disgrace our stupid and I warrant me.
The lad ajectd him then.
Never that sir he said.
He was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm.
now to bed boy.
Tis late and I go myself in a short space.
dismiss your squire robin and bidme good yen.
As any in Angland would say , said Kenewell proudly that is in his day.
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning come.
There was no chance to change his sleeping room to one nearer to Gam well's room .
Recently , he crossed the floor of his room with a decided step.
Will cried softly and stuttly who had located on his couch across from the door of his young master's chamber , sprang up at once an answer.
We will go out together to the Bower . There is a way down to the court room my window.
rest and be still until I warn you.
The hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard around the hall.
Finally , all was quiet and black in the courtyard of Gamewell.
Will whispered to a robin opening his door as he spoke , " are you ready.
They then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs.
Robin entered the heat , dragging the unwilling esquire after him.
be not so foolish , friend said fittuoth crossly.
They moved there after cautiously about the hut , groping before and about them to find something to show that the warrant in idfulfilled as a mission.
There were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuttly tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit.
His hand rested at last upon the top rumn of a ladter and slowly the truth came to him.
Robin carefully descended on the latter and found himself soon upon firm brocky ground.
study was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about ourselves to as certain the shape and character of this mistake .
From the blackness behind the light , they heard a voice warrantons.
Save me a master's but you startle me rarely.
cried , he waving the lanthern before him to make sure that there were no ghosts in front of him.
inquired robin with his suspicion still upon him.
Truly , such a horse would be worth much and notting him fair.
day nad lording antered morrinton with a half laugh.
warrant and spoke thus with significance to show him that he did not to think Jeffrey's claim to the estate would be passed by.
robind Fitsoth saw that his doubts about Western had been onfair and he became machamed to himself for harporing them.
His tones rang pleasantly onwarrantans ears and fourth , the good fellowship was haralded between them.
The old servant told him quietly as they crept back to Gaimwill at this passage led from the hut in the pleasants to Shurwood and that Jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest.
He implores us to be disgreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life as in the hollow of our hands.
They regain their apartment , apparently without disturbing the household
Out in the woods stood a nice little fur tree.
The plac he had was a very good one . The sun showed on him as the fresh air there was enough of that and around him grew many large - sized comrades pines as well as firs.
He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air . He did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries.
but this was what the tree could not bear to hear.
In winter , when the snow lay glittering on the ground , a hair would often leap along and jump right over the little tree.
Oh that made him so angry.
to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that , after all , is the most lightful thing in the world.
In autumn the wood cutters always come and felled some of the largest trees.
This happened every year and the young furtry that had now grown to a very comply size trembled . The sight of the magnificent great trees falling to the earth with noise and the cracking of the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and beare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were ladin carts and the horses dragged othem out of the wood.
Have you not met many people ?
rejoice in their growth , say the sunbeams.
and then what happens then.
I would fay not if I was destined for such such glorious a career , cried the tree rejoicing.
I am now tall in my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh.
were I but old ready on the cart.
I was in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence.
Yes and something better , something still grandler will surely follow or wherever should they thus ortament me.
something better , something still grander must follow but what.
brechoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight.
rejoice in my own new youth.
but the tree did not rejoice at all . He grew and grew and was green in both winter and summer.
and Towards Christmas , he was one of the first that was cut down.
The axe struck deep into the very pith The tree fell to the earth . With a sigh . He felt a pang as like a swoon . He could not think of happiness , for he was sorrowful about being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up.
He well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more , perhaps not even the birds.
but my departure was not at all agreeable.
The Trie Olly came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid , we don't want the others.
There too were large easy chairs , silken sophas large tables full of picture books and full of toys with hundreds and hundreds of crowns and that the children had
The servants as well as the young ladies decorated it.
This evening they all said.
how it will shine this evening
Perhaps the other trees from the forest come to pick me.
It blazed up famously , Help help.
Cri the young ladies athey quickly put out the fire.
a story.
In a story , cried the children drawing the little fat man towards the tree.
but I shall tell only one story.
He filled downstairs and yet he married the princess.
That's the way of the world.
thought the tries and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good , looking well well.
I won't tremble more thinking about the fur tree.
and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought.
In the morning , the servants and the housemaide came in.
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here it had a dark corner where no daylight could enter . They left him.
What's the meaning of this tree.
and he leaned against the wall , lost in revery.
Time had two of his reflections for days and night'ss passed on and nobody came up and when it ended , everybody did camt it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way.
It is now winter outside doors through the tree.
how kind a man is after all.
If it were not so dark here and so terribly lonely.
sweak squick.
They snuffed about the vertree and rustled among the branches.
I am by no means old , said the fertree.
There's many people considerably older than I am.
They were so extremely curious.
I know no such place say the tree.
and then he told us all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said.
said the fur tree was thinking over what he had himself related. to
Yes henriality those were happy times.
Po , who is hopy dumpy , asked the mice.
only that one answered the tree.
It is a very stupid story.
Don't you know one about Bican and Talo candles . Can't you tell any lader stories.
no said the tree.
Then good by said the rats and they went home .
Finally , the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all . It was very pleasant when the sleek little mie sat round me and listened to what I told them.
Now that two is over.
Why one morning there were a number of people who set to work in the loft.
The trunks were moved . The tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard . It is true down on the floor , but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone.
but it was not the title tree that they meant.
It was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles.
The golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine.
In the court yard , some of the marriad children were playing who had danced Christmas around the title tree and were so glad at the sight of him.
and the gardener boy chopped the tree into small pieces . There was a whole heap lying there.
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and its side so teeply.
However , it was over . Now the tree had gone , the story had an end.
to it ten beth refram from delling the other girls or uncle John of old will rogers visit , but they got mister watton in the library and asked him closely about the penalty for fourth Ocheck.
It was a serious crime . Indeed , Mister Watson told them and Tom gates baged fair to serve a lengthy term in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash act.
I can see it in that light , said the old law
It was a deliberate teft from his employer's to protect a girl he loved.
but they could not have proven a case against Lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of a resting her were probably a mere bluff.
He was so hard in impetuous said and being in love he didn't stout to count the cost.
If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forge check , then the young man would be allowed free .
but under the circumstances idoubt of such an arangement could be made.
Fairview was twelve miles away , but by ten o'clock TEY was drawn up on the county train .
They were eceived in the little office by a man named Markhum who was the jailer.
We wanted to talk with him , Kenneth said .
I'm reading for a representative on the republican ticket , said Kennoth quietly.
I'l say that's different observed markum altering is dimmeter.

They followed the jailer along a succession of passages.
Sometimes um that yearn to infer a smoke is nearly crazy . and do know which is worse in one way or the other .
He arnocked the door in called here's visitors tom.
Worse tom worse en error , replied the chailer glomily.
Mister Graff said Kenneth noticed the boy's face critically as he stood where the white from the passage fell upon it.
sartly have an oreception room in the jail.
The town please says the gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice . There's a penchere.
A fresh , wholesome looking boy was TOM the gates with steady gray eyes , an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth.
We have heard something of your story said Kenneth and our interest in it.
I didn't stop thinking whether it was foolish or not . I did it and I'm glad I did it.
hold well as a fine fellow te poor and helpless since missus Rogers had her accident.
Then roders woultn't do anything but leader around and wait for her and the place went to rocken ruin.
He spoke simply but pasted up and down the narrow shop in front of them.
whose name she signed to the check asked kenneth.
He is supposed to sign all the checks for the concert.
It's a stock company in rich
I was a bit keeper so it was easy to get a blink check and forge a signature.
As regards my robbing the company , I'll say that I saved him a heavy loss one day.
I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the entire plent but the marshall never even thought of me.
It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling tent to know the truth.
I'm going to see Mister Marshall , and discover what I can do for him . . Thank you sir.
I won't be much but I 'm grateful to find a friend.
They left him then for the jailor , able to lock the door and stop them at the office.
I've seen lots of those kinds in my day.
and it has runes and jisposition.
He looked up rather ungraciousleep but motioned them to be seated.
Some girls have been here twice to interview my men and I have refused to register .
I'm not electioneering right now.
Oh well sir , what about him.
and he desserves a term in state prison.
It is cos me twice sixty dollars in annoyance.
I'll pay all the conpesides.
You foolish . Why should you do all this.
I have my own reasons , mister Marshall.
Give me a check for a hundred and fifty and I'l hand over to you the forge check and qash further proceedings.
ha dedtested the grasping despisiouson that would endeavour to take advantage of his evident desire to help your gates.
Bet's uneasy silence nudged him.
There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrood face.
He might have had that forge ceck for the face of it if he'd been sharp.
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars.
So , to the surprise of the democratic committee and always friends , Mister Hopkins announced that he would oppose the aggressive campaign with equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars on doing so as might be necessary.
One of his hopkins first pasks after calling his faithful hinchmen around him was to make a careful canvase of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished.
The weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from opposition.
the democratic committee figured out away to do this.
Under ordinary conditions , Renolds was sure to be elected , but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to ele copkins.
The only thingnecessary was to fix seth renalds and these howkins arranged personally.
and this was why Kenneth and I discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
The description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both waughing hartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus her coworkers failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
These women were fluttered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing the first foreigners .
Tle uise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were en listed.
The fair view pant was engaged in discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guess.
tables were spread on the lawn and a dainteep and substantial repass was to be served.
This was the first occasion in a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elherst and the only win within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests.
The attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted to see great success in their fight.
We ought to have more attention between said louise approaching her cousin.
won't you run into the house and see if martha can't spare one or two more maids.
She was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt Jane was their mistress here and that was her special favourite.
The housekeeper led the way and beth followed.
For a moment , betstood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile on her beautiful face.
She was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at Elm Hurst , a black gown with a white baprint and cap.
Then she gave a little and did not miss between Melizabeth
but it can't be protest the girl.
I attend to the household mending you know and care for the limen.
I speak like an educated person who says " wonder where your home. is is
For the first time , the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
She sat down on a rock chair and clasped her hands in her lap , rocking slowly back and forth . I'm sorry , said Beth.
Alye Parsmons shook her head.
Fate excites me in some way and I ca bear them . You must excuse me.
She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.
Beth was a beautiful girl . The handsome of the three cousins by far , yet Alizea surpast her with natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact.
Her person was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well - pred composure and calm reliance.
Her eyes wandered to the maid's hands.
However her features and might repress any evidence of nervousness , these hands told a different story.
She rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catcher breath.
I wish I knew myself she cried fiercely.
Will you leave me alone in my own room or must I go away to escape you.
Aliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and her key clicked in the lock.

The English followed the French baskets of flowers of which they had made a plantable trovision to celebrate the arrival of the young princess . The French in return invited the English to a semester which was to be given the next day.
cangradulations were poured upon the princess everywhere during her journey.
From the respect pain her on all sides , she seemed like a clean person and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three , she appeared as an object of worship . The clean mother gave the French the most affectionate reception . French was her native country and she has suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget friends.
She taught her daughter then , by her own affection for that love for a country where they had both been hispitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them.
They had thrown himself back on his sea leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with his heaving chest and restless limbs.
This had indeed been a harassing day . The young man , his eyes fixed upon his friend.
You will be frank with me as I always am.
Can you imagine Wy buckingham has been so finelent I suspect.
It is you Hermis took Rau . I have read is distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action on the holding day.
I can perceive love clearly enough.
I am convinced of what I say said in the account .
It is annoyance then.
In those very terms , I even have more.
But continued raul not interupted by this moment of his friend . Heaven praised the French who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless , even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to protect matters of such high importants.
Thus it is that the honors of the three issaved are country master's and our own.
Yes , I need repose . Many things have agitated me today , both in my mind and body . When you return to tomorrow I shall no longer be the same man.
But in this friendly pressure rowked detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict.
The night was clear starlett and splendid , the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life , peace and security everywhere.

Braggle on wasched for some time , the conduct of the lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of a manicamp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit.
I have made another discovery.
there was certainly no near solution to their problem.
The poor little things cried Synthia , think of them having been turned to the wall these years.
Now what is the sending of two innocent babies like that.
But happy she had not been listening to all at once , she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion.
The twin brother did something she ded liked and she turned his picture on the wall.
She happened to be in the same frame too , but she evidently cared about it.
Now why do you call Sinpias blog ?
I thought we were stumped again when I first saw that picture , but it was of some uwse after all.
Do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing.
Which in the world is a clear choice.
Maybe I felt terribly strongly and like to see what this lovely fureniture looks like without such quantities of desk del over it it scheme sin.
Wor come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and half a regular house cleaming.
Heu can't hurt anything . I'm sure we won't disturb things at all.
This thought , however , did not enter the heads of the inthusiastic pair.
Smuggling the house claiming parfenelia inside the cellar window observed that afternoon proved no easy task for Synthia had added a wisk brol and dust pan to the outfit.
The leer provfed too much of any sport after it as friskly as a young kitten , much to synthe as delight when she caught sight of him.
Oh let him come along . She urged me to love to see him at that old house.
He makes it sort of cosier.
fell and dusted the furniture and pictures.
yet , little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room.
surface at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish.
Then she suddenly remarked.
and my pocket money is getting low again and you haven't any left as usual.
They say alumination by candle is the prettiest in the world.
Here o go my a hy seeusual they both cried peering in.
who behap the greatest forgivting into odd corners.
forgetting all their weariness , they seize their candles and sturry through the house , finding the occasional paper tucked away in an odd corner.
Well , I confidence at the board et - up house mystery happened not earlier than April Sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later.
No words were spoken , no language was uttered saved waling in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and nodd to reality.
I heard a noise behind me . I turned and saw his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife . He lifted it above his head as if to strike , but he had the strength of ten men and I hurled him at me.
onward said a distant voice.
No sound broke the stillness of the knight.
The story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition I wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said.
what was that.
Then a human hand large and shapely appears distinctly on the surface of the pond.
nothing more , not even the rhythm to which it might be attached.
It did not beckin or indeed move at all . It was as still as the hand of death.
I woke to consciousness fighting at first . It seemed as if I was fighting with the fantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me . It was catfere.
The sound of voices at the flash of light.
a feeling of freedom and I was awake
said another voice which I recognized I like tar cashiers .
I had scarcely known what I had been saying or doing up to this time , but as he spoke , I looked at my hand.
In the light of the moon , I saw a knife rad with blood and my hand too was also discolored.
I do not know I am dazed and bewildered.
but that is caffer's knife.
I know he had at dhis very evening.
I remember saying have we been begether.
Bor chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it.
I say you do know what this means and you must tell us.
A terrible thought flashed into my mind.
I had again been acting under the influence of this man's power.
Perchance too caffer's death might serve him in good stead.
My tongue refused to articulate my power of speech laughed me.
My position was terrible.
my over brought nerves yielded to last.
For some time after that , I remembered nothing particular .
the three modes of management.
to suppose that the purpose of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
my reason and affection.
As the chase drives away , Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep , her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor destrust and suspicion of her mother 's disappointment , vexation and ill humour sirge and swells among those delegate organizations under which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury.
The mother , as soon as the chase is so far turned that she can no longer watch the expression of her continance ghoes away from the door with a smile of complasency and senisfaction with her face at the engenuity and uccess of her little partifice.
So you will be a good girl I know and not make any trouble , but you will stay at home contentedly , won't you.
The mother , in manages the case in this way , relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection.
If you should not be a good girl , what should be signs of making us any trouble ? I shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone.
but this last upposition is almost always unnecessary , for if Mary has been avitually managed on this principle , she will not have any trouble.
It is indeed true that the importance of tac and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated.
To such persons , these interacting modes of training children inhabit of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are especially useful.
Della had a younger sister named Maria and a cousin whose name was Jane.
Now Gellia cantrive to obtain a great influence and a cendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
To guarantee idea of these conversations , I will report one of them in full.
You have come and Della and Dela were the names of Jeane's dolls to make rosely of visit.
I am very glad.
I expect you have been a very good girl and Ella since you were here .
Then turning to Jane , she asked in a somewhat altered tone , if she been a good girl Jane.
For instance , one day the children had to play around the piazza with blocks and other play things and finally go into the house , leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done.
They were now playing with their dolls in the parlour.
The deli came to the parlour and , with an air of great mystery , teckened the children aside and set them to them in a wisper leave and della and rosely here and don't say a word to them.
So said she led the way on tipto , followed by the children out of the room and round by a sircutous root to the piazza there.
said she pointing to the blay things to see.
Put these plea things all away quickly and carefully and we will not let them know anything about you leaving them out.
and this method of treating the case was much more effective in maying them dispose to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been.
nature of the effect produced by early impressions.
That is almost nothing.
These are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing.
Without going to any such extremist this , we can easily see unreflection how vast an influence on ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresse upon the mind.
The pain produced by an apt of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away , but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
But she cared nothing about that.
He made about so deep that his back came to breaking and he was dumb founded I can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders.
He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack nife.
Now this knife was a splendid one , though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and ander's new that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jacknife.
Yes , why not think anders.
Seeing that I am so fine , I may as well go and visit the king.
I am going to the court ball , answered Anders.
and she took her hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and threw them into the matnificent halls where courtiers in silk and vilvet stood bowing wherever they went.
four like is not . They must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
At the other end of the largest hall , a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rose.sssss
on huge silverplatters wore pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering cantors.
The princess sat down under a blue canopy with boquazse roses and she let her sit in a golden chair by her side.
but you must take eat with your cap on your head , she said and was going to take it off.
The princess was certainly beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her , but with the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
He only shook his head.
well but now he said to the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chaine around his neck and thent down and kissed him.
That is a very fine cap you have , he said.
So it is sen anders.
and it is made of mothers best yarn and she mittet at herself and everybody wants to get it away from me.
With one jump , the man got out of his chair.
He darted like an arrow through all the halls , down all the stairs and across the yard.
He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for the king's golden crown , he said that Anders was stupid.
His face grew red.
but his mother hugged him close.
No my little son , she said.
If you were dressed in silk and gold from top to toe , you would not look any nicer than in your little red cap.
At the conclusion of the banquet which was served at Fie o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated custume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornoment workers of the court.
Ah very well.
Lat am come in , then , said the king and , as if Colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself aloront with the conversation , he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two cuartiees.
Juttleman to your posts were upon Saint everyone and friends took their leave.
certainly sir , but I must have money to do that whoat.
What do you mean inquired louise.
He has given them too many great nuts to have others still to give if they are required , which is the case at the present moment.
It is necessary , therefore that he should comply . The king frowned.
do your imajesty then you no longer believe that disloyal attempt.
not at all you are on the contrary , most degreeable to me.
Your majesty is planned in this affair
You will take them from my private treasure.
The news circulated with the repidity of lightning during its progress , it cendled every variety of cocatry desire and whild ambition.
The king had finished his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers.
The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent daas or platform situated upon the border of the lake . , a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction.
Suddenly , for the purpose of restoring peace in order , , accompanied by his whole court , he made his appearance.
The seasons of spring followed him closely to form a quadreal which , after many words of more or less flattering import , was the commencement of the nands.
His legs , the best shaped at court , were displayed to great advantage of flesh - colored silk and hose of silk , so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself.
There was something in his carriage which resembled the boyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to sore along.
Yes , it is suppressed.
Far from its sire , your majesty knew gave no directions about it . They musicians have retained him .
Yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet.
Sire , he said your majesties most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with somilar zeal that he is already shown on the field of battle.
The king seemed pleased with everyone present.
Monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.
the balley began , the effect was more than beautiful.
When the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutered pandemime of the period was only more natural , on account of the various different acting of the August actors had reached its commonating point of triumph , the theatere shook with tummultuous plause.
Disdainful of a success in which Madame showed no acknowledgement , he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess.
By degree , all his happiness , all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness , so that his limbs lost their power . His arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied.
The king , who had , from that moment , become , in reality , the principal dancer in the Quadreal cast , walks upon his vanquished rival.
Everyone could observe his agitation and prostration , which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to seeing him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side , his head bewildered and as his eyes without their bright intelligence were demed.
Upon this , Madame daine t turn her eyes languishingly towards the coming observing.
Do you think she replied with indifference.
Yes , the character which your royal highness assumed is imperfect harmony with your own.
explain yourself.
I allude to the goddess.
The princess inquired .
She then rose humming the air in which she was presently going to dance.
The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
A quarter of an hour later , he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps to live is thus strangely constituted . He found that impossible even to remain much longer supparated from their presence of one who had broken his heart.
When she perceived the young man , she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself.
I please you , the evening is most lovely.
indeed a.
I remember now and I congratulate myself . Do you love anyone.
Forgive me . I hardly know what I am saying a thousand times . Forgive me . Madam was right , quite right . This brutal exile has completely turned my brain.
There cannot be a doubt he received ukindly for , in fact you returned without his permission.
all Madmaselle Why have I n't voted for my sister or a true friend such as yourself.
Well already here , they said to her.
I have been here for this quarter of an hour , replied Labadier.
Did not the dancing amuse you ?
no more than the dancing.
Le vallier is quite a poetus said tonysharant.
I am a woman and there are few like me whoever love me , flatter me , whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well say Montale you do not finish.
It is too difficult , replied Mudmoiselle Detani Shalan , laughing loudly.
Lucky do you not see the moon slowly rising sivering the branches of the chestnuts and the oaks.
exquisite soft turf of the woods , the happiness which your friendship confers upon me.
Well said madmoiselle details I also think it is a good deal , but I take care.
to say nothing , said Montalet , so that when the mudmoiselle deternicharaunt thinks the nay is the only one who knows it.
Quick quickly then among the girls said mountain stoop at because you are so tall.
The young girls had indeed made themselves small , indeed visible.
She was here just now said the count.
you are positive then.
Yes that perhaps I frightened her and what way.
How is it levalier said to madmoiselle detenishant that the vicompd o bregalone spoke of you as louise.
It seems the king will not consent to it.
God gracious has the king any reason to interfere in matters of that kind.
I give my consent.
Oh I am speaking seriously , replied Montale , and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the kings , I suppose , is not bad .
But we ran then said all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses , they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covert of the park.
In fact , the sound of madames and the queen's carriages could be heard and the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers.
And this way , the feeding of the whole court was e fet also for the mysterious anhabitants of the forest , for certainly the deer and the break the pheasant on the branch , the fox in its hole were all listening.
All about him was a tumult of bright and broken colour scattered by broad plashes.
The mergancer had a crested head ears desent dirty black , a broad collar of lostrous white black back , black and white wings , white belly sides finely penciled and black and white and a breast of rich chestnot red streeked with black.
His feet were red , his long narrow beak with its sal tooth edges and sharp hoped tip was bright red.
but here he was at a terrible disadvantage , as compared with the owls , halks and eagles , he had no rending calls.
but suddenly streiet and swift does a diev in cormerant he shot down into the torent and disappeared beneath the surface.
Once fairly awing , however , he wheeled and made back hurdly for his perch.
and it might have seemed that a trout of the size was a fairly substantial meal.
but such was his keenness that even while the wide fluks of his engored dovictim were still sticking out of the corners of his beak , his fierce red eyes were once more ppearing downward into the torent and sarch of fresh prey.
In thespair he hurled himself downward too soon.
The great hock found huridly to get his prey from the ground.
The cat growled softly , vicked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
In fact , he had just minished it . The last of the trout's tale had just tenished with a spasm down his straind gallet when the baffled hock caught sight of him and swooped.
The saw a light on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised.
Like his unfortunate little cousin , the Teal he had felt the fear of death mitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the howk should not discern him.
The howk sat on the branch and waited for his quarry to swim over the surface.
Almost instantly , he was forced to the top.
straightway in the hock lidted from his purch and darted after him.
but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down.
But this frequent term the heights of the air for all his savage valor was troubled by the leaping waves in the tossing foam of these mad rapids . He did not understand them.
As he flew down , reaching utching talent were not happy yards around the fugitives ' head.
where the wavs for an instant sank , they came closer but not quite within grasping reach.
But as before , the leaping waves of the brapids were too much for his pursuer and you could t able to flap his way onward in the cloud of foam old doom that was hanging low above his head yet hesitating to strike.
The hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a wesel not to be shaken off or a vaded or deceived.
He had a lot of lin left and the place was none too free for a long cast , but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was sleeping .
The last dropp fly as luckwould have it caught just in the corner of the hock angrily open beak hooking itself firmly.
At the sudden sharp sting of it , the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank.
The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling.
Then the leader parted from the line.
They welcome figures at the garden parties of the elect who are always ready to encourage him by excepting free seats for his play actors managers nod to him , and allow them to contribute without charge to a simposium on the price of gulf balls.

This would be an easy way of doing it , but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call a technique in itself.
In the old badly made play , it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his compedence.
In the modern constructed play , he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do could something something beamed more natural.

The Bulgus legislature numbered thirty - six members.
This was at the march election eighteen fifty five.
That summer immigration , however , being mainly from the free states , greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties.
For general service , therefore , requires no special effort . The merical strength of the factions was about equal . On extra ordinary occasions , the two thousand border off in reserve lying a little farther back from the state line told it any time , easily turned the scale.
The free state men had only their convictions , their intelligence , their courage and the moral support of the north . The conspiracy had a secret combination of the territoryal fficials the legislature , the vogus laws , the courts , the militia officers , the president and the army.
This was a formable array of advantages slavery was playing with loaded dice.
Come and by way of the Missouri river towns , he fell first among border rouffiand companionship and influences and , perhaps having his inclinations already moulded by his washington instructions , his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free state 's cause.
His reception speech at Westport in which he maintained the legality of the legislature and his determination to enforce their laws delighted his pro slavery auditors.
All the territorial dignitaries were present . Governor Shan and presided John Calhoon , the Surveyor general , made the principal speech , a dinounse tiation of the abolitionist supporting the pikamovement chief justice , lacomfdignified the occasion with approving remarks.
All discent no compliance , all hesitation , all mere silence , even in their stronghol towns like Lebinworth brandered as abolitionism declared to be howstillity to the public welfare and punished with proscription , personal violence , expolsion and frequently death.
After the lanchings the mobs and the murders , it would be impossible except in a very extended work to note the frequent and atrocious details.
The present chapters can only touch upon the more sailient movements of the civil war and cansas which happily are not sanguinary If however the individual and more isolated cases of bloodshed could be described , they would show a startling aggregate of barbarity and a loss of life for opinions sake.
Several hundred free state men promptly responded to the summons.
It was in fact the best weapon of its day.
The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
One of his militia generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at lawrence and elsewhere to surrender the sharp's rifles , another rod asking him to call out the government troops at fort level .
The governor , on his part , became doubtful of the legality of employing missouri militia to enforce cansas laws , was also eagier to secure the help of federal troops.
Her Jones had his pockets always full of rids issued in the spirit of persecution that was often baffled by the sharp wits and ready resources of the free state and sometimes defied outright.
Little by little , however , the latter became himd and bound in the mashes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials involved in the bogas laws.
To embarrass this damaging exposure , the judge lacamp issued a red against the ex governor on a frivolous charge of contempt.
The incident was not biolent nor even dramatic . No possy was summoned , no further effort was made and the readers , fearing personal violence , soon fled in disguise.
but the affair was magnified as crowning proof that the free state men were insurrectionists and outlaws.
from these again sprang barricated and fortified dwelling camps on scolp parties , finally cuminating en roving gerilla bands , half partisan , half predatory.
Their distinctive characters , however , display one broad and unfailing difference.
The free state men clong to their prairie towns and prairie veins with all the obstinancy and courage of trudyfenders of their homes and firesides.

Well , the former said that the scottish peminenters were secretly forming a union with the English parliament and incalcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking , the latter still in sisted that every such tempt would precipitate his intermeasures to which otherwise they were not perhaps in cline.
The kings ' ears were now open to Montrose's counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in Scotland.
Five hundred men who had been levied by the covernanters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and , with this combind force , he hastened to attack lord Elco , who lay it something with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the Irish invasion.
dreading the superior power of Ourgile , who having joined his vassels to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army , Montrose hastened northward in order to rouse again the marquie of huntly and the gordens who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the comenenters.

The weak cavalry here lined his troops of horses with infantry and , after putting the enemy's horse on the road , fell with united force upon their feet who were intirely cut to pieces , though with the loss of the gallant lord Gordon on the part of the royalists.
from The same men knew regiments and new companies were formed , different officers were appointed and the whole military force was put into such hands as independence could rely on.
Besides members of parliament who were excluded , many officers were unwilling to serve under the new generals through their commissions and wearily cilitated the project of putting the army in tirnally into the hands of that faction.
The discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible , a more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders.
Valor indeed was very generally deffused over one party as well as the other . During this period , discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament , but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seemed still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting.
Historians , at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience , have not remarked on any thing but a head - long , impetuous conduct , each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determined the success.

The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise.
What is called perception differs from sinsation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associated images and expectations of their usual coreletes all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation.
Whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions , every one would agree that it has a broad measure of truth , though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that I das proximately represent impressions.
and what sort of evidence is logically possible.
There is no logical impossibility in the high pothesis that the world spring into being five minutes ago , exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past.
All that I am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember.
The behaviourest who attempts to make psychology arecord of behavior has to trust his memory and make the record.
A habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviorist fhills confident that there is such a phenomenon as a habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times.
but I do not think such an ifference is warranted.
Our confidence or lack of competence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself . sense we cannot avoke the past botily and compare it with the present image.
We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague , which , yet we do not trust . For example , under the influence of fatigue , we may see a French face vividly and clearly , but horibly distorted.
Some images , like some sensations , are very familiar while others seem strange.
Familiarity is a filling capable of degrees.
In an image of a well known face , for example , some parts may feel more familiar than others . When this happens , we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts.
I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past.
They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.
In actual fact , there are doubtless various factors that can cur and give us the fill of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event.sssss
There may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pastness , especially where immediate memory is concerned.
There is , of course , a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
It would seem that only recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of fiellings giving their temperal relation to the present , but it is clear that such fillings must play a special part in the process of dating remembered
If we had retained the subject or acted on knowledge , the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple.
Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or lated to what is remembered.
These points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
In this case , as in most others , what may be taken certain in advance is rather vague.
The first of our vague but intubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
We might provisionally , perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue and our knowledge of the future . Such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned , though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy.
This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory , but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory.
A grammar , with the help of seuitable records , relates to the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramiphones as they like to believe.
I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before , such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be a habit that enables me to do this.
The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.
Semmons to books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all .
They give waws according to which images of recent occurrences come into our minds , but do not discuss our belief that these images referr to past occurrences , which is what constitutes knowledge memory.
It is this that is a venturost to theory of knowledge.
It is by no means always reliable . Almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.
Whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object , it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object , which leads us to the judgment this is familiar.
Thus , no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
A further stage is recognition.
direcognition and this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of sociation the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.
We are , of course , able to judge when we recognize the object that we have seen before , but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible for animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sence of the word.
This knowledge is a memory in one sense , though another it is not.
There are , however , several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with . It might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as I have seen this before than as it has existed before.
The definition of my experience is difficult . Broadly speaking , it is everything that is conducted with what I am experiencing now by certainlangks of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.
Thus , if I recognize whether the occasion of its previous existence , by virtue of which I recognize , it forms part of my experience . By definition , the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single oubt from the rest of the world.
Of course , the words that have existed before are a really inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition , but that is unavoidable which are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means permitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as it recognition.
I stayed there alone for many hours , but I must acknowledge that before I left the room I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.

On arriving at home and my own residence , I found that our house was filled with brilliant company.
As I spoke , I made him a gracious bow and I think I showed him by my mote of address that I did not bear any grudge as for my individual self.
I have come to your sures mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this disin quarter of the world.

Their masters said the missus never bend.
I did not mean to say Captan battllax tho touch upon public subjects at such a moment like this.
missus never been . You should be proud of your son.
Jack was standing in the corner of the room talking to Eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises.
Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player , said my wife.
and my wife and son and the two cress wellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship next.
This I felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and I endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion , but I could not believe that something was wanting in the simplicity of my ordinary life.
My wife , on the point the moment , managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner.
This she said was true hospitality and I am not sure that I did not agree with this .
Then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who , ere , for the most part , the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.
Oh yes , said jack and I'm nowhere.
But I mean to have my innings before long.
of what the missus had never gone through and providing birds , beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day , no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplishe her task with thorough success.
We sat with the officer a little time after dinner and then when ashore.
How much of evil about real accomplished evil has not occurred to me during the last few days.
What can I do now but just lay myself down and die.
and the death of which I dreamed could not alas.
When this captain should have taken himself and the vessel back to England , I would retire to a small place which I possessed on the further'sside of the island and there in seclusion would end my days.
Jack would become a happy husband and would remain amist the hurried duties of the eager world.
Thinking of all this , I went to sleep.
Mister never bent began the captain and I observed that up to that moment , he had generally addressed me as president . . The cannot be considered that we have come here on an unpleasant mission.
You have received us with all that courtesy in hospitality for which your character and English stand so high.
It is a duty said I.
but your power is so superior to any that I can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yielding to it.
Not a doubt , but had your force been only double or our own I should have found it my duty to struggle with you.
That is all quite true . Misters have never been said sir famous Obran.
I can afford to smile because I am absolutely parilous to you , but I do not feel that in a matter which the progress of the world is concerned or rather we have been put down by brute force.
You have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction.
Therefore , I feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a kourtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally.
I can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since I have been on board
Then he said sirferd Nando , there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him.
It came upon me a sudden shock when I heard these words which exceeded anything which I had felt.
You hear what Sir fer mand o Brown has said , replied captain battle ax.
but what is the delicate mission asked.
I was to be taken away in carriageto England or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage and it mattered not which
Then the republic of British Yula was to be declared as non existent and the British flag was to be exalted and a British governor and stalled in the executive chambers.

You will allow me to suggest him , but that is a matter of opinion.
If I complied with your orders without expressing my own opinion , I would seem to have done so willingly hereafter.
The letter ran as follows.
Sir , I haven't incommand to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called Britain Yula.
The procurlar circumstances of the colony are within your excellence's knowledge.
But in their selection of a constitution , the British uless have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprong their present difficulties.
It is found in the acknowledged weaknesses of those who survive that period of life in which men cease to work.
but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of entering at once upon your governor.
John Brik is armed with a weapon of Greek power against which it is impossible that the people of Britain Yulo should prevail.
You will carry out with you one hundred men of the North Northwest Burmingham regiment , which will probably suffice for your own security , as it is thought that mister has never been withdrawn , the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience.
When do you intend John to start.
Today I was exhausted .

Your paret is sufficient , I said.
If you give us your promise to meet captim adlax here at this time in Morrow , we will stretch a point and delay the departure of John Bright for twenty four hours.
and this plan was adopted too , in order to ebxtract from me a promise that I would depart in peace.
This was what dared the misthiv so far as running away was concerned.

When this had been accomplished , the boolaro leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before.
At once , the goat gave a leap to escape from the soldiers and with a bowed head rushed upon the booloroo.
Before any good stopped him , he butted his majesty so furiously that the king 's sword went into the air and tumbled in a hape among the benches where he lay Monday and grown

The pity that we must come and go.
While the old gold and the marble stays forever gleaming , there is a soft strong blaze calmon early evening glow.
The pleasant gravyard of my soul with sentimental cybris trees and flowers is so filled that I may stroll in meditation at ease.

Oh life this spring.
Why is the fate of the water.
Why are you afraid of these children of spring.
Fell is like a strange bow and like a parting cloud , like a reflection in a glass , like shadows in the water , like dreams of infants , like a smile upon its infant face.
Wike the duve's voys like transient day like music in the air . Ah.
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of that walket in the guarden in the evening time.

O little Cloud , the virgin said I asked me to tell me why thou complaines now when in one hour thou fadaway then we shall seek me but not fine ah fell is like to thee.
I passed away yet I complain and no one hears my voice.
The cloud then showed his golden head and his bright formemurge.
and feierce thou because I fanish and am seen no more.
It is a ten fold life until love is peace and ractures clearly unseen , descending my light wings upon the flowers and courting the fair eye to take me to her shining tent . The weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen son.
till we arise linked in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all the tender flowers.
live not alone nor do they fear not and I will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice.

The helpless warm rose sat upon the lilyes leaf and the bright cloud sailed on defined his partner in the veil.
image of weakness art thou but a worm.
I see they lay helpless ing maket weeping and not to answer none , to cherish thee with mother's smiles.
and say thou mother of my children , I have loved thee and I have given a crown that none can take away.
and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot.
or an eye of gifts and graces showering fruits and cointed goal.sssss
Why is a tongue impressed with honey from every wind.

I sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy islads from an unaverd - yet pronicle inward joy.
I did not wrong myself , but I placed a wrong on thee.
When called before , I told how hastily I dropped my flowers or broke off from a game.
showiy never miss homework and blessings and the common kiss the cons to each turn , nor count it strange when I look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this.
Alas , I have grieved , so I am heard to love.

Good it means to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow.
Nay , I was rather thrilled to distrusting every light that seemed to guide onward path and was afraid to overlean a finger even.
And though I have grown serene and strong since then , I think that god has willed a renewable fear.

Then I long tried natural ills , receiving the comfort fast . While budding at thy sight , my pilgrim staff gave out green bleas with morning doomed impearal.
I love thee freely as men strive for . I love him purely as they turn from prays.
I loved him with the passion put to him in my old grees and with my childhood's faith.
I loved the with a love who seemed to lose with my lost saints . I loved thee with the breath smile teared of all my life and if god toose I shall but love the better after death .
